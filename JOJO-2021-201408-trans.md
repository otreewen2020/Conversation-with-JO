# Conversation with JO 2021

**Thank you for allowing the energy of light to enter your life. It illuminates not only you but also everyone you come into contact with! — JoJoYou**

## 2021/01/24 - Everything is the best choice on your life path

**Higher Spirit:** First of all, thank you. Thank you for actively linking to me. Then, indeed, I have a lot of information to bring to you You now feel that you are indeed a person with psychic abilities, and you are also a disseminator, that is, to convey information, convey our high-latitude information. You are a very pure energy body So it would be very, very good to convey information through you. So I'm very happy that you are willing to be the person to convey the information. Then your energy state and your personal state are also very suitable for being our candidate. So we are very happy that you can agree to be a disseminator with us.
You want to continue to know how to connect better. Then what I want to tell you is that you don't need to be anxious and don't push it to speed it up, because everything will happen just right. So when you are worried or concerned or pushing something to be completed quickly, you are actually destroying it. So the only thing you need to do is trust, trust and believe that everything of yours is on the right speed and the right path. 
The only thing you need to do is to trust, relax and believe. Also, take passionate actions and do this. You can continue to ask about other things.
I can now see the number 44 repeatedly appearing. I wonder if this represents that you are telling me that we have been together. I have been very frustrated recently because of the identity issue. But I saw a video whose marked time was 44 and the content was "to let go is to receive". I wonder if this is the message you want to convey to me.
**Higher Spirit:**We exist by your side all the time, every moment. We have no distance. Only in your material world there is the concept of distance. We have no distance and no space concept.
Then regarding your rather agitated mood, just like the previous information, everything is proceeding at its own pace. So you only need to believe that everything is going on the right path and at the right speed. You don't need to worry or be afraid of anything because all the arrangements are the best choices on your life path.
When I was a child, I could have an out-of-body experience. Once, a white-robed guiding spirit came to me. He stood on the moon and I stood on the Earth. He wanted me to go over to him, but I felt in my heart that if I went, I wouldn't be able to come back. Then instantly, I returned to the Earth. Another time, a huge dragon came to me. I told it that I couldn't leave yet. I want to know what is the relationship between me and them?
**Higher Spirit:**Because all of you are simultaneously existing in many different dimensions. So you can sense some things that happen in other dimensions. You can sense them now too. It's just that, currently, your body hasn't received regular training. Just like a water pipe, there are blockages inside. And because you don't use that water pipe, there are other debris inside. But if you use this water pipe frequently, there won't be too many impurities inside. It's always active. So your psychic constitution, as well as your body, your ability to sense, perceive and feel other dimensions also need to be used frequently for it to run smoothly. This is an ability and a technique. Any ability and technique requires you to use it frequently for it to become smoother and smoother. So you still have this ability in this aspect. It's just that you need to constantly improve it, adapt to it and connect it.
It's like the current circuit is in a short-circuit state. It's not connected, but the circuit is right there. You just need to connect it.

**Question:**I want to know what I can do to better connect with my guiding spirit?
**Higher Spirit:**That's right. First of all, you have to believe that you have the ability to communicate with spirits and perceive other dimensions. Because if you doubt, you can't turn on this switch. First of all, you have to be 100% trusting and believing, because this is the first door. Only when you enter the first door can you continue to do other things. Because your minds will often pop up to question. When you start to question, you will go back and examine what you said, did and acted. Then you will think this is a wise approach, that is to think twice before acting. What you said, you think this is a wise approach. But on the psychic level, it's not. If you think or if you intervene artificially, then your connection will be broken. So, you need to surrender yourself completely and trust completely. This is the first step.
When you trust completely and encounter situations where you can use psychic abilities, just do it. It's like believing that you can fly without any fear and believing completely that your wings will come out the moment you start to jump down. If you don't believe or hesitate, your wings won't come out and you won't jump down either. Do you understand what I mean? So it's not that you have to recite any incantations or do something to enlighten yourself. But if reciting incantations makes you believe more that you already have, that is, the permission of self-awareness, and if you think that your psychic ability will come after you recite the incantation and you believe it, then you can do it. But what really works is not the incantation but your one hundred percent trust in yourself. No matter what way, as long as you can obtain your complete trust in yourself, you do it. There's nothing.

**Question:**Can you see how my current state of consciousness is?
**Higher Spirit:** This doesn't have any meaning because it's only used by you humans to distinguish and define. And there isn't any grade or number to measure your state here because in every state, every state, it's the state that should occur at that time. That is to say, every state of yours is exactly what you need at the moment. So for you at the moment, that time is the most perfect state. This is what I mean that you should not use any behavior to push yourself to prompt something to happen. When you are prompting, you are actually in a slow process because that is what your brain is pursuing instead of following the speed that your own life should have. Just like a young sapling, it has its own growth process. You cannot force it to bear fruit in spring. Do you understand what I mean?
Moreover, it has the beauty it should produce and the experiences it should have at every stage and every season. You can't take away your experiences. If you take away your experiences and directly give you abilities, it's a very dangerous thing. Once you have that ability, you won't use it correctly. Instead, it will bring devastating harm to yourself and others. Do you understand what I mean? So previously, when you still don't know how to use your abilities, it's a very good protection for yourselves and the people around you. When your inner self seems to have gained enough experiences, all experiences are not what you say in words that you understand its theory and then it becomes yours. It's not like many scholars who have knowledge and theories, but they can't solve their own problems. These are two different things.
So knowing some theories and some knowledge doesn't mean that those are truly yours. You must go through experiences, experience by yourself, and then understand why there is such a theory and why this sentence exists. After turning it into your own true feelings and insights, only then is it your inner growth. Only then does it truly belong to you. If you don't go through this step, the latter that you obtain, that is, the superficial ability that you pursue, first, this is rather unlikely. Second, it will only receive devastating harm. It won't produce the effect it should truly have. So you don't need to be anxious now. Don't push yourself. I don't know how to say it in Chinese. Don't push yourself. Don't force yourself. Don't force things. Every period has its own natural beauty. So don't examine yourself either. Don't judge yourself either. Because everything doesn't have a perfect and ending state. This series of processes, this series of processes, it is constantly and continuously transforming all the time. If it is a constantly transforming thing, an energy, a state of consciousness, what do you say is the result? If you measure yourself, at the moment when you are measuring yourself, you have transformed countless times. You tell me which one is you. That is to say, people in your material world should learn not to judge a person or a thing with any words, or with a number, for example, when you give grades to people during exams. This kind of behavior, for example, when you do something yourself, you say you are a bad person. Such things shouldn't happen because the moment you are expressing yourself, that person no longer exists. Do you understand? 

**Question:**Does that mean living in the present moment?
**Higher Spirit:** Because there is no past. Because even the present moment you are talking about, this instant, the moment we say "right now", this moment has undergone countless changes and transformations. How can you evaluate that by the time this sentence ends, you have traversed billions of times? How can you determine that you are an existence full of changes and constantly changing? Do you understand what I mean? So you don't have to be obsessed with any of your thoughts, because the moment that thought arises, it has already vanished. When a thought arises, it has already vanished. Therefore, those thoughts and emotions are not you. You are one full of countless variations, constantly transforming and changing infinitely.  
The term "ever-changing" is the best to describe you. All of you are ever-changing. How do you define that? It's like when you imagine there are many, many fish in front of you, constantly swimming and swimming. When you want to catch one fish, it has already escaped to another place and you simply can't catch it. That is to say, there is no fixed existence here. There is never a fixed existence, fixed result, or anything fixed.

**Question:**Can I ask a few more questions?
**Higher Spirit:** I like you asking questions. Because when you ask questions, this psychic girl is constantly absorbing this wisdom and then this wisdom will all become hers. So you are not bothering or disturbing her.
Because you are making progress together. She gives her time, experiences and wisdom. This is her kindness. The kindness she gives is all doubled back to her. So she keeps growing, keeps changing and keeps accumulating wisdom and experiences for herself. Therefore, she is also the biggest beneficiary. So you don't need to feel that you are disturbing her, consuming her or wasting her time because this is also what she needs. Because if she doesn't need this course, the one we are currently talking about. If she doesn't need this communication, then she wouldn't have joined this group at all. If she has joined, then it means that this communication is also of great significance to her growth.
You should believe that everything you do in the material world, its influence is not only yours. It is agreed that all that join in this are benefited. It's like a fight occurred on the street. You see only two injured people in this fight, but actually the onlookers are also injured. Do you understand me? When you see another act of love on the street, the ones who feel the love in their hearts are not only those two people, but also the onlookers around. They will all benefit because all of you have chosen the occurrence of this event. You choose to be a bystander of this event, and you will also benefit from it and receive the lessons you should receive. That is to say, there is no one-way benefit or victimization in all things. When the offender harms others, he himself also suffers the same damage. That is to say, whatever you do, give, or pay, you will receive the same return. If all the humans on your Earth knew this reason, then you wouldn't do things that harm others because you know that your act of harming others is actually harming yourself. While you love and respect others, you are also respecting yourself.

**Question:**I want to know the relationship between me and my guiding spirit.
**Higher Spirit:**Which me are you referring to? Which me are you asking about? Are you asking about the relationship between the entity that is currently transmitting the message and you? Because I am you, and you are me. We are all one. So it doesn't exist. According to your statement, that is to say, you are one person and I am one person. We are independent. But we are not independent. We are all connected. All of us are closely related and connected together. Any growth of yours is also my growth. So there isn't any. Just some would choose to express in this way to make you understand better. There is a saying in China: Tao gives birth to one; one gives birth to two; two gives birth to three; three gives birth to all things. That is to say, you and I are all things. But we all come from Tao, that is, energy, consciousness. It's like we are a vast ocean. You are a wave, and a water droplet leaves the sea surface and floats up. But sooner or later you will return to the sea. Do you understand? At that moment your wave stands up and becomes a spray. Then you will think this is me. I am this spray, and you are that spray. Then you will distinguish between you and me. But in fact, when we fall down at that moment, this is psychic. When you fall down and enter the entire ocean and the sea surface, you can perceive all the information of the entire ocean. 
**Question:**Does that refer to a state of oneness?
**Higher Spirit:**Yes. When this girl is in a psychic state, this psychic connection is what she herself wants. Because when she is in this state, she is in a state of oneness. When she is in a state of oneness, she has no troubles. Because when she is not in a psychic state, she is a person of your world. When you are a person, your mind constantly generates thoughts, constantly generates, and more or less generates some emotions and troubles. But when she is in a psychic state, she has no troubles. She only has inner peace and joy. So this state is what she wants to perceive, sense, and experience. So when she is in a psychic state, that is, in a state of oneness. That is, for herself, it is like a baptismal state, like a state of cleansing, a state of charging. Because she felt unity, she no longer pursued from the outside, because people in your material world still pursue from the outside.
For example, from emotions, from others to pursue, feeling complete. Because when you are not in a state of unity, you always feel a sense of deficiency, thinking that I need something to fill myself, such as my other half, such as a partner, such as a lover, such as a career. For example, you are always grasping something to make yourself feel complete, understand? So those workaholics, people who work frantically, they feel their incompleteness, so they think they are constantly working to enrich themselves and constantly let something fill themselves. Any addictive behaviors, such as being a workaholic, being a shopaholic, drug use, alcohol consumption, any kind of behavior. For example, constantly changing boyfriends, being in love, changing girlfriends, constantly seeking sexual partners. All of this is because of your inner sense of deficiency and loneliness, and then constantly wanting to grasp something from the material world to make yourself experience a short-term state of unity. But you have to remember that such states are only temporary because it will soon disappear. When it disappears, you will feel anxious, and you keep wanting to grasp. When you can't grasp it, you will have low mood or resistance. You will think it's the other person's fault that he didn't satisfy you, so you will constantly want to feel complete, fulfilled, and unified. 
But all these are illusions, all these are mirages, all these are temporary and will disappear in an instant. The true unity is only in this state.
When you reach this state, you can lead more people to find the true unity and complete state because you have found the way home. Then you can lead more of those beings and lead them to find the way home. Only this is true. Do you understand what I mean?

**Question:**I am now connecting with my guiding spirit through the way of meditating while listening to music. I want to know if this is okay or is it better to have no music?
**Higher Spirit:** The form is not important. No matter which way you use, if you are not happy in your heart and do not enjoy this thing, then don't do it.
Meditation doesn't mean in your minds that you think only when you are sitting cross-legged is meditation. No. When a painter is concentrating on his painting, he is also in a state of meditation. When a singer is completely immersed in his singing, as if there is only him left in this world, this is also in a state of meditation. Meditation is connection, just like unity. Just like you are a wave, when the wave rises, you have to return to the sea. The form is not important. What is important is which one is more pleasant, more enjoyable? That kind of feeling, more enjoyment of that kind of feeling. Instead of saying that you push yourself, you think you have to force yourself to reach a certain state. If you think listening to songs makes you more comfortable, more relaxed, and you enjoy the process more, then you listen to songs. If the singing doesn't bring you this kind of feeling and you think not listening to songs is better, then you can choose not to listen. There is no such thing as a correct path here. The real path for yourself is for you to constantly experience and feel, and only you know. And at each stage, what you might like could also be different. So there are no fixed rules. You are a very serious child. That is to say, for example, you are a child who studies very seriously. Sometimes, in fact, you just need to relax and trust. Do you understand what I mean? You want to do things well, plan well, and choose the correct path. But there is no so-called correct path. There are only paths that suit yourself and paths that make you full of passion and joy. 
问: But now there are many things restricting me from doing what I really want to do. I want to experience economic freedom and life freedom, but now there are many things that have to be done.
**Higher Spirit:**During this experience, you can also learn and experience what you need to experience. The only thing that can shorten this experience and time or make you more pleasant is that you put your awareness into every moment, that is, you are in an awake state every moment, rather than a sleepy state, and not influenced by your collective consciousness. Do you understand what I mean?

**Question:**What is an awake state?
**Higher Spirit:**An awake state means, for example, that what is implanted in your mind is not the viewpoints and concepts of others, not given by others, and not some norms given by your society.
For example, it's like just now you said you were looking for a way. Maybe your teacher was teaching you, and this is the correct way. Your minds, this is the limitation for you. Then you're not awake. You're using the way of others' achievements. Understand? You have to understand which ones are the social consciousness and not yours. When you are using those social consciousnesses, you yourself step aside.

**Question:**I may find it difficult to discern which are my own consciousness and which are others'. 
**Higher Spirit:**Yes, yes. This is why the number of awakened people is so few, so few, so few. The number of truly awakened people is very small. You see many religious people or other spiritual mentors. Although they keep saying many principles, they are like tape recorders. They are also, like guidelines, a serious student.  
There's also perhaps the process of you wanting to eat hot pot. That is to say, when you're on the way to eat hot pot, at the table of eating hot pot, when you're sitting there eating hot pot, then you see a scene, and that scene is the source of your inspiration. Do you understand what I mean? So let your inner self lead and guide you, because only it is your true teacher and mentor, not me.
As long as you feel happy and you want to do it, then just do it. This is the only criterion, that is, your inner self is in a comfortable state, an enjoyable state, and a state where you want to do it. Whenever you don't want to do it anymore, you stop. There is never a fixed rule here. That is to say, the rule I'm telling you now only applies to you at present, but in the future, that is to say, at this moment, it may change.
and That means you haven't walked on the path that truly belongs to you. Because when you choose to walk on your own path, everything in life is arranged, and there are no obstacles. That is to say, for example, this girl who is speaking now, the life she is experiencing at present is completely different from what ordinary people like you experience. Because when it's time for her to do that thing at a certain point, everything around her will be ready. Do you understand? For instance, if she wants to go swimming at the seaside, the car, the driver, the swimming suit, and all those things for her to go swimming at the seaside will all be automatically in place and ready. She just needs to have the desire to do it and experience it passionately, which is enough.
This is the true path of life. But currently, she is indeed experiencing such a life state. For instance, recently she wanted to give a public speech. The public students were ready, the venue was ready, everything was ready. She just needed to show up. She didn't need to consider where to go, where to find people, which place to go to, or what to talk about. She didn't even know what she needed to talk about and she didn't consider it because she knew that the moment she took that position, everything would automatically present itself. Many of you, when giving speeches or doing such jobs, need to search for topics in large quantities, prepare lessons and so on. But she didn't do anything. She knew she would show up there and everything would be just right. She would know how to proceed. This is total trust. So you also need to slowly walk on this path.

**Question:**I woke up again recently and saw my spirit body bowing respectfully to the Jade Emperor and the Queen Mother. At that time, I heard a voice saying that the time had come, and then a person took a child in white clothes out of a trapped town like a stone. And I also knew that the child was me. The moment I saw the child being released, the Jade Emperor and the Queen Mother also came, and then I saw one of my spirit bodies bowing respectfully to them. I want to know what this means.
**Higher Spirit:**Just now it was said that you all exist in many different dimensions at the same time. That is also if you say what is real, as long as you can experience it and you have a profound experience, it is real. So even if you are dreaming, the experience in the dream is also real for you. Then in the physical world, when you are experiencing something, if you think it's not real, then it's not real for you. Do you understand what I mean? The real so-called reality is your inner experience. For example, if someone loves you and is very nice to you, but you don't feel the love at all, then it's not your experience. It's only the other person's experience. The other person is experiencing it alone because you haven't joined in and you haven't experienced it. But even if you love a mythical figure, but you really love him and you have devoted all your feelings, then tell me, is this false for you? Because it's having love with a mythical figure, but your feelings are real.

So only what is real for you is real. For you, if you have no experience, what is false is false and you don't care whether the thing itself is true or false because it's your mind that judges. Because even if you take something you think is real, for example, a cup, and you think it's real, if you keep decomposing it with your science, decomposing it, you will find that it is also false. Do you understand what I mean?

**Question:**(I forgot what I said...) 
**Higher Spirit:**Yes, what you said means that there is no real or false here because there is no need to distinguish which is true or false because only when you have that feeling yourself, it is real. Just like when you are in a dream and you feel the panic of being chased by someone, for you, even if others say it's false, that it's false that you are being chased 
But your sense of panic is real, it's real for you and everything that needs to be said to you today is that trust, relax, and enjoy is enough 
Q: I have no further questions, thank you


## 2021/02/06 - Magic Wand 

**Question:**Now the girl who is channeling wants to know how to use a magic wand 
**Higher Spirit:**First of all, she became interested in the wand because she was now beginning to move to a stage of how she could use her energy field to influence her surroundings, to influence the physical world, to influence other people and she wasn't interested in this for no reason because she was currently very much in sync with her higher self so that she was receiving this kind of guidance and now going into this kind of exploration. Then all this information can help all of you who are interested in this aspect with some very good guidance. Then your question is how to use your energy with a wooden stick or a magic wand. First of all, you need to be clear that the most, most, most important thing is yourself, your energy body, your mind, your consciousness. It's just like that stick is just a wire, and if you don't have electricity, it's no use having a wire. Do you understand what I mean?
So the effect is not on that stick, but what really affects is your mind because your consciousness is linked to everything in all things. Then if you want to manifest, manipulate, or influence a certain part of matter when you are linked to everything, don't you still have to start from the link? So because you don't know what you currently want to show, influence or do with the magic wand, you need to ask more specifically to get this information.

**Question:**Forgot what to ask specifically.
**Higher Spirit:**You yourselves are constantly manifesting everything you experience in your physical world with your consciousness. All fairy tales and TV series are just manifestations made quickly and promptly by you, which seem like magic. So first of all, you need to be clear that you yourselves are manifesting everything with your consciousness and intention. For example, if you have a quarrel, fight or brawl with someone, but this event, first of all, its conflict occurs in your consciousness, that is, you have developed a dislike for this person, do you understand? So if you have no feelings or sensations towards him within yourself, you wouldn't have such quarrels or fights with him. So when you are quarreling or fighting, it's actually a manifestation. That's also your magic coming true, understand?

**Question:**How to manifest in a timely manner?
**Higher Spirit:**Timely manifestation. Do you want to use a magic wand to manifest in a timely manner? For example, you hold the magic wand and say "a frog" and point, and then you expect the frog to appear? The magic wand, for you, exists in a kind of enhancing effect. Because for yourselves, for example, your trust in yourselves is not very deep. It's like thinking "I don't trust that much". It's like when I don't have a crutch, I can't walk well. It's like when children ride bikes. At the beginning, they need a balance because they don't believe that they have a balance... They think they will fall. The magic stick has such an effect for those who are initially not particularly confident in themselves. He feels that when he gets that magic stick, he will have more confidence in what he does. Do you understand what I mean? But when he reaches 100% confidence in himself, he doesn't need any magic tools.

So the magic stick is more like something a child holds onto when just learning to walk, or the two balancing wheels of a bicycle when just learning to ride, achieving an effect that makes him feel safe, at ease, certain, and confident in himself. Because without it, any doubt would make it impossible to fully engage in what you want to do. Another kind is people in your material world. That is to say, if you have no decorations or clothing on you, they won't think you are a magical person. But if you wear some solemn clothing and hold some solemn ritual implements, those people will deepen their trust in you. So whether it's yourself, just like your police officers, if they wear uniforms, you will have a greater sense of solemnity towards them in your hearts, and they themselves will also have a sense of solemnity. So this is also like the effect of uniforms. It can not only deepen your own determination of your own identity, because no matter what state you want to enter, you must first enter that identity and determine that identity. So to say, for you all, if wearing costumes and holding magical tools can enable you to enter that state better, can make you believe in yourself more, and can also make outsiders believe in you more, then do it because it's a plus for you.

**Question:**(Can't remember exactly what was asked. It seems to be asking Teacher JoJo how to explore using the magic wand.) 
**Higher Spirit:** How to explore? When you generate concerns, curiosity and questions about this aspect, when your questions arise, you are already obtaining the answers and are already exploring. So it's also at the moment when your thoughts arise. Therefore, the moment when things in the material world seem so is the moment when your thoughts arise, the moment when your frequency aligns with that. This is why she likes to constantly answer others' questions and help people in trouble because these are like a rope, a clue, and behind them you can find what you are looking for together, like an energy line that will lead to the answers you want to seek.
So it is not fixed to only one form or way. Even if she suddenly sees an ant on the ground while walking on the street at any time, it can also bring her into the field she wants to explore. So at any moment, it is like a door into the field you want to explore. When your mind is worried, anxious, or focused on other things, then you close that door. Do you understand now? Then you aim at the focused door, and then many anxious events will be triggered. This is a sentence that you often say, called "Misfortunes never come singly."

**Question:**Then if when I start to feel anxious and scared, I shout stop to this energy and meditate and think in a positive direction?
**Higher Spirit:**Doing so is like taking painkillers when you have pain. It eliminates your symptoms, but the disease that causes your pain still exists. This is the main reason why all of you come to the material world - to enhance your ideology. When your ideology is enhanced and expanded, for you, for example, when you were a child, the teacher gave you questions, some complex multiplication or addition problems, you would feel anxious and think it was so difficult. But when you look at these problems again in your teens or twenties, you won't feel anxious. Why? Because it's very simple. This is a change in your perception. When you learn, you understand, and you know, after that, you won't feel anxious. You feel anxious because your current ability can't handle some problems you encounter at present, and then you will have a sense of anxiety and helplessness. But when you understand that you can solve these problems well, you won't feel anxious, right?

People feel fear and anxiety because of their misunderstandings of the world and their misunderstandings of an event, that is, the wrong perception of this event. Understand? Just like the girl just now, the information she shared herself. She said that some people take everything manifested materially too seriously and get too involved in the drama. Then if you know that you are just using your body to experience the material world and you are not that body, you won't be obsessed with the pain and desires of the body. When you are too obsessed with physical desires, or wealth, or, for example, the desire for power, various desires, a desire for status symbols, the desire for status, if you are too obsessed with, that position, that title, such as the governor, if you are too obsessed with the identity of the governor, then you will definitely suffer. Why? Because it's impossible for you to be a governor forever and ever for your entire life, do you understand?
So when your consciousness is elevated, and you can understand that you are here to experience this identity, and your main focus is your inner self, then when you are not obsessed with this identity, you will not have that kind of anxiety and pain. So it doesn't lie in how you act externally, but in how you improve internally. Has your perception improved? Has your consciousness expanded? Because when your consciousness is elevated and expanded, when what seemed like a problem at that time, you look back, it's no longer a problem. Just like what is said in Buddhism among you, everything is empty. If everything is empty, then why should you be anxious and why should you suffer?

**Higher Spirit:**First, I would like to share what suffering is. Because suffering is just a definition of yours, humans. For some, for example, there is a saying that a cornered dog will jump over the wall. That is, only when you push that dog to the limit can it know that it has the ability to jump over the wall. Understand? So some suffering, the suffering that appears on the surface, is just to stimulate your greatest potential, and those sufferings are usually chosen by them to experience. For instance, some people who have constantly paid attention to those who were raped might have experienced being raped numerous times themselves. They can understand their pain, so they will rescue those similar to them. They chose to go through these themselves, so they can empathize with them and know how to lead them out. So sometimes, those sufferings are chosen by them because these sufferings are conducive to their transformation. This is one kind of suffering. There is another kind of suffering that is defined as suffering by your material world. That is to say, it is not suffering in itself, but your lack of understanding of it defines them as suffering, and what you experience is suffering. Just like when you exercise in the gym, with hundreds of pounds of weight, constantly exerting force.  They know that light exists and not just darkness. So some people think that saving others means giving up oneself to save others. This is not saving. This is you acknowledging the pain of others and their predicament. You just need to be yourself and shine your inner light. However, those in the darkness see the possibility that they themselves can also become light, and then it brings them hope. You let them see all possibilities. However, there is no so-called saving because just like everything (inaudible) is mutual. It's not that there is a certain misunderstanding of that word "save". When you help become the light and illuminate others, then the light of others will reflect back to you and make your light even brighter. That is to say, whatever you send out will be returned to you double. 
Although Osho himself said that he did not and did not want to save anyone, his existence illuminated many people and liberated many people. Although he did not deliberately do the act of saving, it's like you are a seed. You grow well, blossom and bear fruit. You bear many fruits. You didn't grow, grow and blossom deliberately just to bear fruits. But bearing fruits is an inevitable result. Do you understand? However, your fruits contain many more fruits, and then there are constantly lives within the fruits, constantly lives. But you say I don't want to bear fruits, I don't want to spread, I don't want to bring new lives. Do you understand what I mean?

**Question:**Now this girl who is psychic wants to know how she can do to see other beings.

**Higher Spirit:** She has already seen other beings in her dreams. What you want to say is how she can see beings from other dimensions in your material world, right? Let me take a look for you. She wants to know how she can see some other beings in the material world. She hasn't expanded to that extent yet. But for her at this stage, it's a form of protection. That is to say, she will reach that extent and be able to see beings from other dimensions in the material world. But currently, her energy state hasn't manifested to have such contact. It's a protective behavior for her at present. That is to say, it's like there is one of you at different levels. If you are a particularly, particularly, particularly skilled master, I can give you a very sharp knife.
If you are a primary school student and have just learned how to cut vegetables, I might give you a child-sized knife. However, you say, "Why don't you give me a sharp knife?" Because at different stages, you need to have the same items that match your energy state to support you. Things that are too sharp can cause harm and influence to yourself and others. Why hasn't she reached the stage where she can see? Because there are still some fears within her that she brought along when she chose this physical body. Those fears have not been completely cleared away. However, if she is allowed to see those beings now when the fear within her physical body has not been completely cleared away, it will deepen her fear and be unfavorable to the process of clearing her inner fear. So when she has no fear within herself, she can come into contact with and be able to see with the naked eye some beings from other dimensions. Do you understand what I mean? First of all, you have many, many, many mentally ill people, right? Because they don't have, that is, their abilities don't match yours. Do you understand? They saw it, but their state couldn't bear such a thing, so they couldn't distinguish what was real and what was an illusion. So they caused their mental problems and had to go to the hospital. They couldn't survive like normal people. So they had that ability, but at the same time, it also ended their ability to live a normal life in this material world. It was a fatal blow to them. Many children later, they have this function. They have a very, very great fear within them. They are accompanied by a fear that is difficult for normal people to understand. Imagine now that right next to you, suddenly there is a person. You can see exactly what he looks like, everything is crystal clear. Could you still live a normal life? Even if he is friendly, because when you came to this material world, this function was closed. It is a protection for you.

**Question:**That is to say, she could see one day, right?
**Higher Spirit:**Yes, it is possible. First of all, that fear is a protection for your physical body. This fear is instinctive and is to protect you. Just like what you said, fight or flight. When you encounter an emergency, your first reaction is to want to escape. This is an instinct. It is an instinct that each of you has. It is to protect you. Then the phenomenon you mentioned, I need to link. What's your name, XXX? You want to know about the sleep paralysis you are currently experiencing. The current state you are in is actually an accumulation of your inner fears. When you accumulate a lot of fears, you will attract some fearful phenomena, or fearful events, or some entities with the same sense of fear. However, these entities only deepen your experience and do not provide you with any substantive help. That is to say, they are not like high-level spirits. Do you understand? They are more on the same frequency as you are currently. So if you want to change your experience, you still need to change your frequency and put yourself in a more relaxed, happy, and blissful state. Instead of being in a state of loneliness, solitude, fear and helplessness, do you understand? Because of your state, what you attract, whether in the material world or the spiritual realm, is based on your frequency. Only people with the same frequency, like this girl who is psychic, she needs to adjust her frequency to a certain state to receive this information. When she is in this material world, for example, the troubles of the material world, some events of the material world, she cannot touch this information. This is also a state achieved by adjusting her frequency. If she lowers her frequency to fear or a very, very low frequency, she will also attract some problems similar to that frequency, that is, there are the same internally.
Just like you people in the material world, birds of a feather flock together. Those who like gambling have people around them who like gambling. Those who like taking drugs have people around them who take drugs. Those who like making money have people around them who like making money.

**Question:**I'm currently practicing the Thirty-Six Principles. Some time ago, during the practice, suddenly a stream of hot air ran through my whole body, and then my whole body became hot. I want to know why this happened to me. Have I gone astray?
Higher Self: Are you talking about going crazy due to practicing Qigong wrongly? This isn't. This is just a dredging of your body because there are many blockages of energy in you, that is to say, there are some suppressed emotions and suppressed energy inside. However, when you link to the cosmic energy and allow the cosmic energy to enter your body, there will be a feeling like dredging. This is the same as your hypnosis, suggestion, and self-hypnosis. This is the same as you all. Just like those actors acting, no matter their thoughts, their emotions, their expressions, after they enter that state, they will feel that they are really in that state. This is also the state of spiritual communication. This is also the state of achieving a connection with your past life. Because you have experienced many lives. You have had many lives. That is to say, whether you have been a poor person, you have also been an emperor, you have also been a rich person, you have also been a servant girl. When you are wearing the servant girl's clothes and doing the servant girl's actions, you unconsciously become a servant girl. When you are wearing the imperial robe and doing the emperor's and empress's actions, you unconsciously become an empress. Your tone will become the tone of the empress. Understand? This is why sometimes props and costumes are also very important to you because it will deepen your self-suggestion. That is also helping you suggest to yourself that you are now the emperor and you are wearing the imperial robe.


**Question:**How to connect the conscious and subconscious minds? With meditation? How should one meditate?
**Higher Spirit:**You don't need to meditate. Every moment in your life is like that. For example, when you are an employee and you enter the company, you will enter that state. When you are a customer and you go to a hotel, to a five-star hotel, and you are being served, then you are in the identity of a guest. Understand? Just now, among all the material phenomena you mentioned, you are experiencing them yourself. For instance, when you get home and you are in the role of a daughter, your attitude towards your mother is different from when you are in the role of a subordinate and your attitude towards your boss. When you are in the role of a girlfriend and facing your boyfriend, your attitude is different. When you are facing a waiter or an authoritative figure, it's different again. Do you understand?

**Question:**I want to ask my guiding spirit, does my Higher Self have any information for me?
**Higher Spirit:** I'll help you search. You currently have one piece of information. And what he wants to tell you is that you still have many beliefs that limit you. That is to say, you yourself should have 100 points, but you only give yourself 50 points. You feel unworthy and undeserving. This is a point that you need to break through, need to see, and need to recognize. It's that you are more excellent, wonderful and deserving than you imagine. However, some of your beliefs have blocked some wonderful things from happening to you. Understand? Some of your beliefs, some of your thoughts have prevented some goodness from coming into your life. It's that you yourself think you don't seem to deserve a better life. You think you don't deserve better treatment, a better life, better love and care. Such a belief has limited the wonderful things from coming into your life. But you will break through these beliefs step by step.
That is to say, this is a process for you to break through. Eventually, you will have all of this. Understand? So this is just a process of your transformation and breakthrough. Then it's just to tell you that you are currently going through this process of transformation and breakthrough. So you don't need to worry or be anxious, and you don't need to, just like the messages written by this girl today, you don't need to pay attention to what you don't have or what you lack. You only need to focus on what you have. For example, focus on yourself. You are a very kind, very considerate of others, and very compassionate person. You are a very good person in yourself. So if you focus on the fact that you are a good person, you will attract good things to come to you instead of paying attention to those things you worry about and are anxious about. It's just a different focus point. One is A and the other is B. You don't need to worry about B. You only need to focus on A, which is enough.

**Question:**Thank you for the information you brought to me

**Higher Spirit:** Thank you. You can still ask one more question 
**Question:**How to release those negative beliefs?
**Higher Spirit:**First, you don't need to focus on anyone's ideas, anyone's methods, even if it's the Buddha, understand? Because even if it's the Buddha, he also tells you that all dharmas are empty and none of this is true. So people can use their consciousness to create any event they believe to be true to experience. Then if there are 6 billion people in your world, and each person has created a unique consciousness to experience, and each of them is real. Then which one do you believe? There are 6 billion different ones. Which one do you believe? So here there is no, no, no one is true. It's just different viewpoints, different angles, but all are true. For them, if it's true, it's true. You don't have to pay attention to others, because when you are focusing on others, you miss yourself. Everything you have is within yourself.

**Question:**How can one break free from the cycle of rebirth? Is it necessary to eliminate all subconscious fixations?
**Higher Spirit:**When you want to eliminate all fixations, isn't this a fixation itself? Then how do you eliminate your fixations, because you already have them. When you pursue not being reborn and eliminating fixations, this is already a fixation. Do you understand? So you have already fallen into that trap. As I just said, everyone creates an illusion for them to experience. If you take their illusions as real, judge them, and study them, then you miss the most essential nature of your own life. This is why a true master doesn't let you read too many books, doesn't let you listen to too many words from others, and even if it's his own words, you shouldn't listen. You should use your own eyes and your own heart to feel life. Is there still any question?

**Question:**What is karma?
**Higher Spirit:**Karma. You tell me what karma is, then I'll know what I want to explain.

**Question:**Karma is a kind of force. It's that you get what you give.
**Higher Spirit:**This is just to make you clear about what your consciousness manifests. It's just to make you, as if it were a physical reaction. What you throw out is what you harvest. For example, if you have a choice and you throw out a bunch of flowers and a knife in the material world and you still don't understand karma, you will, perhaps, throw out many knives, and then you also receive many knives. 
When you understand later, the knife I received was because of the knife I threw out. Then what did I throw out? I threw out my love, threw out my flowers and applause. So what you received is also this. Therefore, it has no good or bad. It's not to punish you. It just allows you to see clearly. In this way, you will act more consciously instead of randomly throwing knives unconsciously, just like a machine. What you put in, for example, a soymilk machine. If you put in soybeans, it will produce soy milk. If you put in rice, it will produce rice milk.
If you put in stones, it will produce stones. Do you understand? It's just such an operating mode. Okay, thank you. I'm very happy to communicate with you today. Goodbye.


## 2021/03/04 - Which room did you choose in the end? (No question)

**Higher Spirit:**You speak. What's the problem? **Higher Spirit:**Who am I? Tell you. You don't know who I am either.

My name is Yina. Hello, your future. What is the future for you? You can only experience the present, the moment. Do you understand what I mean? You only have the present, only the now, only the moment you are experiencing now. Each of you thinks there is a future. The future is just what you see in your time, but for you, it's not the real future. Just like today is your future, it was your future before, but for you, you only have the present. Don't you understand? Then can you go to the future?
That is to say, you seem like aquatic plants floating in the water. You feel insecure and unstable, and then you want to take root, but there is nothing in the water, and it is also void. Do you understand what I mean? That is to say, you now want to find something, as if it were, something truly reliable. You think only in this way can it hold you down. Otherwise, you will float as if in this state of stepping on air. Within you, you feel that the material world doesn't seem to belong to you because there is no place for you to take root here. So within you, this desire to break away from the material world has arisen. Do you understand what I mean?
**Higher Spirit:**It's just your physical body. You feel like breaking away from the material world because you want to truly find your belonging. You think this place doesn't belong to you. This is your current inner state.
**Higher Spirit:**This is why you want to grasp something as if you were giving yourself a reason to survive, understand? But this kind of inner feeling that you have arisen, this kind of feeling that there is no, like the feeling of having no foothold, is a lesson that your soul needs to break through in this world. That is to say, currently you are facing your lesson, yet you want to choose how to evade, that is, how not to complete this lesson, understand what I mean? Your lesson is when you float on the water surface like aquatic plants, and this kind of unstable and seemingly helpless feeling, in such a situation, it seems that no one can help you or there is no reliance. You need to stimulate your inner self-confidence and inner strength. Your self-confidence and your inner strength. You need to break through these two obstacles. They are obstacles for you but in fact they are not. But you choose such scenarios for your learning because all the scenarios in your material world, or the predicaments in your eyes, are for you to break through, to let you know that there is nothing here. In fact, it is nothingness. Because the inner lack of self-confidence or disbelief or powerlessness are all illusions created by yourselves. But due to your solid physical bodies and everything external, that is, everything you can touch, see and feel, all of this makes you not feel the slightest bit of falsehood. When you have fear, you always think that the wall is impregnable. But when you see through that this is actually just an illusion projected by your inner self, then it is like air and there is no wall at all. Understand? 
**Higher Spirit:** Your future life will still continue to experience the same as now because you haven't seen through this wall, the soul courses you set for yourselves. You must challenge, experience, and complete them before you can enter another different creative scene for you to break through. That is to say, you are now in the material world. Everything about your inner feelings and outer experiences is as it is now. For example, if your current soul is at level one, then even if you change a place, a job, or a partner, you are still experiencing the level one course. Only when you truly complete level one, for example, this course is about your self-confidence and inner strength, your inner self-confidence. Then when you have the inner self-confidence and strength, you will enter level two. Then level two is different from the environment and material state of level one, and the relationships are also different.
After you go through level two, then you can break through to level three and level four. If you haven't truly stimulated your inner self through external situations, because that's the real you. If not through this, you will continue to experience the environment, emotions and energy state of this level. Even if you are rich, you will still continue to experience level one. Understand? Not all rich people are unrestrained and have no fears. 
**Higher Spirit:**I'm just telling you, I'm just telling you that you're only pursuing superficial money into your pocket. It won't change your inner situation, and it won't change your inner feelings. Even if someone gives you a sum of money now, but that money will be spent, and you will still continue to experience this sense of helplessness, powerlessness, scarcity, and terror. Do you understand? Because that money wasn't manifested by your inner strength but by external charity. So you just prolong your course time and growth time.
**Higher Spirit:**Remove the limitations in your mind. It's like water. You're blocking it now. Clear it, and the water will flow out. It's not about teaching you how to generate water because the water is already there.
**Higher Spirit:**I just told you to remove your own limitations. It's like the source of water. There's a board blocking the water. 


It's not that there is no water there. Instead, it's that you need to remove that obstruction, and then the water will start flowing.
**Higher Spirit:**Regarding your future, let me sense it. Right now, I only see that you seem to be in a struggling state, just as if you were drowning now and you wanted to grasp something. So indeed, what you are experiencing now is a rather struggling and helpless state. But what you seem to be seeking in your heart currently is a guarantee. The guarantee I'm talking about is like you want to have a reassuring pill. But I can tell you that you yourself are a guarantee. This guarantee means being precious and having many precious things. However, the only thing you need to do is to believe and then discover. When you discover this process of guarantee, this is the process of your life's fulfilling growth.
The only thing you need to do is to believe and discover. However, the decision-making power lies in your hands. It's not because of growth. Even if I were your biological mother, I couldn't replace your own growth lessons. This belongs to you. No one can replace anyone's growth. Not even us. Not even you in the material world. For example, imagine if your child has the same situation as you. At the beginning, you help him by saying, "I'll give you money." You work hard to earn money for him. He can, for example, rely on the money you give him for the first 50 years. But after he turns 50 and you pass away, your physical body ends. You can no longer protect him and create this false sense of security for him. After you can't create this illusion for him, he will be even more powerless and have an even harder time getting up. Because his body has developed an inability to make a living on its own, do you understand? So your process of creating an illusion for him is delaying him. It's like he's stuck in a quagmire. The more you do that, the deeper he sinks. Keeping him there and feeding him a few bites won't make him happy or experience true power or the essence of life, do you understand? So for all the external things about you, you say.
**Higher Spirit:**Only by changing your inner self, only by changing, will your water start flowing. Only by removing a block, now the blocks are all blocked. Only by removing one can it start flowing. The act of removing it can only be done by yourself.  and 你要把果⼦送到我嘴⾥,明⽩吗
⾼灵: 因为什么原因 因为你,我刚才说你现在⽬前的状态,就好像有⼀种在⽔⾥⾯挣扎的状态这只是一个你表现、体现的⽅式⽽已
⾼灵: 你该如何不犯病也就是说当你⾃⼰⽤你⾃⼰的⼒量努⼒的爬上了岸边过后, 你便不会在⽔⾥继续挣扎,去体验⽬前你经历的所有⼀切体验⼀切的体验都只是表⾯的症状,最真正的归根结底的是在,就是同样⼀个原因导致的It will have different manifestations.
**Higher Spirit:**The fastest way for you to have money now is to see where there is money and go and get it there. This is the fastest way. This sentence means that if there is money in the bank, you can go to the bank to get the money.
**Higher Spirit:**If you can't get it, you can figure out your own way. See who has money and go and get whose money.
**Higher Spirit:**Because this is the necessary experience. You need to experience and continue to experience. If solving the problem of having money is your only problem, then you can solve this problem immediately and then leave you with a series of experiences of fear, helplessness and terror. Then you yourself will understand why you can't just blindly pursue money. Because in your world, there are many people who just want money, so they go to rob banks, they steal and they embezzle because they only have money in their eyes. You currently have no difference from them. Just do it because this experience is also growth for you and makes you know that money can't solve your problems.
**Higher Spirit:** Then you go and rob a bunch of money. See if you will feel secure.

**Higher Spirit:** I can't see your future because I can only read based on your current energy state. Only when your energy state changes can I continue to experience. It's like here, XX has five possibilities. You are currently choosing possibility A. Your current state is possibility A, and the emitted state is possibility A. I can only enter possibility A. Then for B, C, D, E, these possibilities, you only have to adjust yourself to B. That is to say, it's like we are watching TV now. 电视频道有放各种频道这个是恐怖⽚,这个是喜剧⽚,这个是唱歌的,这个是跳舞的那么你现在给我的是恐惧,你说我能看到什么结果
⾼灵: 是的,我只能继续的去体验你制造的更多的限制因为你⽬前是在给⾃⼰制造很多限制来困住⾃⼰
⾼灵: 什么叫做⾃⼰制造很多恐惧,限制⾃⼰你⾃⼰看看你⾃⼰⽬前的所有⼀切,你就能明⽩因为像我刚才说的,外在的呢堵实实在在的墙是你⾃⼰投射和显化加固它的你只有去把你的眼睛真正的睁开,⼒量打开过后,⽤⼿摸出去过后你才知��呢是虚的When your hand dares not stretch out due to your inner fear, what you see is a thick wall. If you don't dare to open your eyes or touch it with your hand, then you will always feel that thick wall. When you gather your courage and believe in yourself and reach through with your hand, you will realize, wow, it's empty. Do you understand what I mean?
**Higher Spirit:**You can listen to the recording repeatedly. Any questions?
**Higher Spirit:**Regarding your thought of suicide, I told you at the first moment. You want to leave this material world now. What you need now is as if someone were to tell you, just as I said earlier, like a mother telling you: Child, mom works hard to give you a sense of security. Don't be afraid. I will support you until you are 50 years old. After you are 50 and mom is gone, you still have to face this problem. Do you understand? So you must, through your inner eyes, reach out and discover that that wall is illusory, does not exist, and it is you who have given your power to it and strengthened it.
**Higher Spirit:**If you do not adjust your state, currently, it's as if you are choosing Frequency A. If you do not adjust the frequency, even if you get married, you will still continue to experience the fear, helplessness, and insecurity you are experiencing now, just with different objects. You will create the same feelings. Many, many people who have gotten married will feel even more insecure in their marriages. So they will do many things due to their inner insecurity that cause great pain for both sides. So even if you find a partner, he is also creating the object that makes you feel insecure. Because that illusion will sooner or later be shattered. This is why many people are sweet before entering a relationship because she still experiences that illusion. When she increasingly feels as if this board is not solid, as if there is a feeling of stepping into emptiness, then problems will surface.
So in your material world, if you rely on external things, such as people or objects or money or something, power, all kinds, to bring you a sense of security or to bring you a sense of happiness or joy. If you rely on and build on this kind of relationship, sooner or later you will always feel the same kind of feeling as before. You will still experience the same because what you have built is illusory. It's not, just like when you are in the water and you think that tying your rope to a piece of wood makes you safe, but that wood is illusory. Because everything in the universe is constantly, constantly, constantly changing.
**Higher Spirit:**Because experiencing pain is also an experience, and experiencing limitations is also an experience. Only when you have experienced limitations before can you feel the feeling brought by not being limited. If you have always experienced no limitations, then you won't experience the feeling brought by no limitations. So you need to be in the darkness to see the light. If you have always been in the light, do you understand what I mean?
**Higher Spirit:**Because you are only judging a person as good or bad by looking at the most superficial material world. You can see many beggars who can be very happy. You can see people who have no money at all, and they can be very happy. Then you also see those who have money, have houses, they are very painful, they have difficulty falling asleep, they quarrel every day, and they also commit suicide. Do you understand? So what you said that if having money means being happy is impossible. For example, as I just said, that person embezzled. After embezzlement, he had money, but he has been living in fear and terror all the time. He is afraid of being discovered and reported, so the fear he experiences is no different from yours.
**Higher Spirit:**Because all your experiences are projections of your own inner fears, but you want us or others to take away the things you projected. This is impossible. The only thing you need to change is like at the beginning when you chose Room A, which is full of fear, helplessness, and sadness. Once you enter this room, there can only be A, and you continue to experience A. If you choose B, which is happiness, openness, trust, and abundance, then you will experience the things in B. 
You have been standing in A. Let's bring the things of B to A. This is impossible. It's like a very simple truth. If you constantly emit a bad smell from your body, but you say, "Don't let flies come. Don't let flies come. Don't let maggots grow. Don't let maggots grow." You say, "I want bees to come. I want bees to come." First of all, you need to become a flower, and that flower is not a plastic one. It's a real one that emits pollen and fragrance. It's from within you. That is life. Only then can you attract.
Because everything that operates in your material world is frequency. These are some symptoms of the manifestations of all your situations. I have already told you before that it will manifest in different symptoms. If your internal symptoms do not improve, even if you get married, even if you have children, even if you change in any way, these symptoms will still manifest.
It will be reflected in the aspects of marriage and family. Do you understand?
**Higher Spirit:**Yes, I see that you currently only want to separate from your physical body.
**Higher Spirit:**Whether you can do this or not is up to you, but I can tell you that this will prolong your time and your experience.
**Higher Spirit:**Yes, that's why you use numbers and names to label each one. So you can't understand us with what you understand. I'm just some existences floating around you. However, my existence is everywhere. It's like no matter where you are, if you reach out your hand, you can catch a thread. That thread connects everything. All things and all people are connected by a thread. Everything you experience will be meaningful. Even if your current experience is in the dark, I can help you get rid of the fear in you now. You just need to close your eyes gently. I will envelop you with my energy. You will feel the tension in your body leaving bit by bit. When you close your eyes, it's like a bird shaking off some fear from its feathers. You are now a frightened bird. All the tension and fear are on your feathers. I am now enveloping you with a green light. The green light slowly enters your body. It will always be with you. Whenever you are anxious or afraid, it will slowly cover your whole body like leaves, leaving no place for those tensions to land. XX, you are now experiencing peace, harmony, oneness, calmness, and tranquility surrounded by the green energy mass. Continue to let this green light envelop you. Thank you for today's information


## 2021/03/18 - Shaman

**Question:**Can shamans treat terminal illnesses that hospitals can't cure through spiritual communication? This girl who has the ability of spiritual communication wants to know how she can treat diseases through it.
**Higher Spirit:** You want to know about the ways and methods of shamans in treating diseases and how to enter the spiritual communication state to treat the other party. First of all, what I want you to know is that the first is the case of treating diseases. For example, there is a connection between the person who was cured and the case, that is, a patient who has not reached the end of his life. This time is a turning point for him and a rebirth for him. Then they will go through the arrangement and each other, understand? It's like the two of you are actors. You are a shaman, I am a patient. The drama of the two of you, the plot of your script is arranged to be written together. When you meet, when to treat the disease. So it's not really the ability of the shaman that cures the person's illness, but rather that person himself will have such a supernatural experience. The supernatural experience makes him transform again, brings him to the front of this spiritual world and gives him confidence.
So if that person doesn't have such an arrangement in his fate, then he won't meet the shaman. He won't encounter such an opportunity to be spared. Can you understand what I mean? That is to say, all of this is already arranged. It just seems to outsiders like the shaman cured his illness, but in fact, it's his own plot arrangement. This is what you call the method. Then even if you don't meet in person, even if you don't do anything. If you have such a plot, I mean, even if you just tell him in one sentence that all your illnesses are gone, his inner self will handle everything. So there is no need for what you call singing and dancing and performing various ceremonies. The reason for doing such ceremonies is to deepen your degree of belief. If for some people you just say in one sentence that all your illnesses are gone now, he may not believe it very much. But if you speak a lot of unintelligible languages, sing, dance, and dress solemnly, he will enter a hypnotic state. 

**Question:**How to conduct spirit communication with the deceased souls to help others?
**Higher Spirit:**Communicating with the deceased souls is the same way as our current spirit communication. You need to use your consciousness and intention, just like dialing a phone number. You need to tell, using your intention to tell the object you want to see, the object you want to connect with. It's that simple because once you enter the state of spirit communication, you can extract all the information. So you just need to call the other party's name and send it out, and you can connect. Do you have any more questions about this?

**Question:**Can I try to connect with my grandpa now?
**Higher Spirit:**Yes. What's your grandpa's name?

**Question:**Do I have to say his formal name?
**Higher Spirit:**As long as he knows you are calling him.

**Question:** I only know that his surname is Sui and I call him the Sweety. If I call him the sweety, he may know that what I want to ask is whether he wants to tell me and what he wants to say to me 
**Higher Spirit:**Sweet, I can feel a very excited, that is, a burst of crying energy is approaching. Then I ask him to communicate with you now. He can tell what he wants to say through this lady, because she allows him to convey to you To communicate with you that he's been watching you, that he's been giving you love and then he lets you know that you've never been apart you've always been linked, connected.

All the events that happened in your life, all your experiences, psychological activities, and then he knows that he wants you to pay attention to your family members, your father's heart, emotions, mind, and spirit. Because he is not like what he shows. But because of your one-sided understanding of people's inner activities, it is also very difficult for you to truly help him solve some of the problems he is facing. So he wants you to, more often, accompany your father in a calm way. Because of the inner torment, inner unease, and inner anxiety of your father, which are greater than what he shows. What he shows is no problem, but in fact, his heart is now suffering greatly, and he is also avoiding that kind of inner torment. Besides this information, he also wants you to know that when making choices in your future, career choices, you must often be with this psychic sister and follow her, because she will change your destiny and be of very, very great help and assistance to you. She can make your dreams and life very perfect and happy. Then he also tells you that he will always love you, and the love has never stopped or left.
Whenever you want to contact him, you can. Regarding this information, do you have anything else you want to ask him before he leaves the link?

**Question:**Nothing. I also hope he is fine.
**Higher Spirit:** OK, thank you.

**Question:**Can you help us connect with Zhuangzi and let him give us some information?
**Higher Spirit:** Zhuangzi 
We are now linking to Zhuangzi and then letting Zhuangzi convey some information to you. You can ask me whatever information you want to know. The more information you ask, the more I will output.

**Question:**The question I want to ask is that your consistent proposition has always been nature, free and easy, and the pursuit of a kind of casual and peaceful life according to your heart. So, what kind of help does the belief you pursue bring to today's society, that is, what kind of constructive direction does it have?
**Higher Spirit:** First of all, what I want to say is that this is not a belief. It is just an attitude towards life. It represents my attitude towards life. What kind of help my attitude towards life can bring to this society depends on each of you because each of you is a member of society. For example, you can start from yourself. Do you think some of my attitudes towards life will bring any transformation to you?
Because of your transformation, you will influence a series of people, such as your father, your mother, everyone you come into contact with. You influence them and then they transform this society. Because it's not that a set of theories placed in an era will lead to a certain outcome. Because theories are dead things and when they enter everyone's hearts, they will bring about different changes. It is you who create and build a place and space where you want to live. Can you understand what I'm saying? Then, what else do you want to ask about this issue next?

**Question:**It's more meaningful for us to understand and create in our own way through your theory, right? **Higher Spirit:**You can ask specifically about one, for example, the casualness and nature you just asked about. You bring up a specific one, and then we can give a specific answer. 
**Question:**We understand and create in our own way through your theory. Is this more meaningful? **Higher Spirit:**You can ask specifically which one. For example, the casualness and nature you just asked about. You mention a specific one, and then we can give a specific reply.

**Question:**For instance, when encountering some obstacles in life, many people can't get through them. But I think when using your set of theories at this time, we can face them. But sometimes people think about this set of theories, but in fact, they haven't achieved it deep in their hearts. It's actually very difficult to let go. So I just want to say that theory alone is definitely not enough. How to transform theory into reality is a relatively difficult process. How to achieve it, **Higher Spirit:** I can understand what you said. For example, being casual and free-spirited. Some people tell themselves to be more casual and free-spirited, but their lives are still filled with tense energy. That is to say, even if you keep telling them, they still can't do it. Then your question is how to truly make it, that is, to become like what was said. First, some of the concepts and ideas we put forward are not because I follow these words. I don't have the words "casual and free-spirited" in my mind first and then learn to obtain them. Instead, it's because of my summary after going through experiences. Do you understand what I mean? So you also need to take a path by yourselves. After you finish, summarize your insights and feelings and leave them for future generations. It's such a model. Rather than just learning what the teacher says. What the teacher says and what we express after understanding and grasping may not be the same. Although it may be about the same thing, we are expressing it in our own language and with our own insights. So you also need to find your own way and open up a new path. Because each of you is unique. Then you leave your words for future generations. That is to say, you are not following in my footsteps or taking my path. My path belongs only to me and is unique.
After finishing, I wrote some insights, left some insights and some thoughts. Theory is something dead. When it enters everyone's heart, it will produce different changes. It is you who build and create a place or space where you want to live. 

**Question:**I'd like to know what your life is like. Do you have marriage and love? Have you ever come to Earth? Then what excites you and what do you pursue?
**Higher Spirit:**Because during this short period of our communication, many, many different spirits have joined and they are all participating in this conversation. So which one do you want to ask about?

**Question:**First of all, what is your life like?
**Higher Spirit:**Now to answer your question, I want to convey some pictures and images in her mind, so that she can directly describe to you what our life is like. First of all, we don't have any material physical shape.
That is to say, currently we are in a state that you can't see. It's like the invisible energy you mentioned. Our life, we have no form. We can only align some of our... I don't know what word to use. It's not thoughts, nor a small part of energy or a small part of frequency with you. You can search for and perceive it, and then transform it into your language, and then for you. It's like the radio in your material world, because we've always been there. We don't come and go. We don't disappear. You just need... It's like the wireless network that is always there. You just need to turn on the network and you can connect. So we are also always there.
Do you know there is a saying in Buddhism called "Neither arising nor ceasing"? It has never disappeared. So now, the spiritual entity that you call and to which I'm conveying information, we don't have any physical bodies. We do whatever every day because we don't have physical bodies like yours. But we can, for example, go to your Earth. We can explore whatever we want to explore. For instance, I'm investing a bit of my energy now to communicate with you. Similarly, because we aren't limited by objects, we are scattered everywhere. So while I'm communicating with you now, there's a part of me sunbathing by the seaside, another part of me is in the woods, and another part of me is in the sea. We are everywhere. Do you understand what I mean? With your material minds, it's very difficult for you to understand.


**Question:**So you exist on our Earth, existing on our Earth in various ways. 
**Higher Spirit:**It's not Earth. It's the entire universe. Earth is just a small part of our energy projection. Most of us are not on Earth. But we can, as you might say, come and play for a while to have an experience. That is to say, I can use a small part of my energy to experience a tree, and then I am that tree. Then I use its eyes. This is like in ancient times when some of you would communicate with trees. What they communicated with wasn't the tree. We aren't in the tree for a long time. Only when they want to communicate, we are everywhere. So in this way, it also makes you understand that your Higher Self, your greatest existence, is also everywhere like us.

**Question:**Then do you have feelings? Do you have a sense of touch? Then do you have the seven emotions and six desires, do you have marriage and love?
**Higher Spirit:**We have transcended everything. What you said are just some aspects of your material world. We have surpassed all emotions, feelings, love, hate, and sentimentality. These emotions that you humans have, we don't have. We only have continuous experiences. We only have love. We allow everything because if someone manifests it, then that thing is meaningful for his growth. We allow everything. That is to say, just like a child who wants to manifest a devil to play with because he wants to experience fear, this is also allowed and supported. Your material world rejects some terrifying events, terrifying things, or negative things. You only want to experience the good. This is a wrong decision.
Because just like a child playing a game, for every experience, he can have it, because you know it's just a game. You know he's just fighting with shadows. Do you think a shadow can hurt him?
He can't hurt the shadow either. If you know that everything you manifest in the material world is just fighting with shadows and the shadows can't hurt you either, would you be nervous or scared? This is one of our states, so we won't be terrified or prevent or anything, because we know it's just a process of the game. But the most precious thing is your realization and perception. Your inner experience is the most precious. What is our daily life like? We don't have a physical body like you that needs to be taken care of, needs to eat, needs to do a series of exercises or do other things. 
We have no physical bodies that need to be taken care of and no physical bodies that need to rest. So we just exist. We are everywhere and we are not restricted by time and space. It's not that I have only one self. If I am here today, I can still go elsewhere. It's not that if I am in the room, I can't go to the seaside. It's your physical bodies that are restricted by these spaces.
We are not subject to any restrictions, nor are we restricted by time.

**Question:**Can people enter your dimension after death? Or what is the space that people enter after death?
**Higher Spirit:** If you mean your personality, your personality needs continuous learning and growth. Why does the material world exist? The material world is for the growth, learning and exploration of your personalities. Then it's not that when your personality dies, you can enter our dimension. Do you understand?
It's not like this. But a small part of our dimensional energy can be invested into the personality. I don't know how to make you better understand the state we are in, a space that can't be reached just by one's death. But our energy can project a small part into your human body. After entering the physical body, it will split out an independent personality. Do you understand what I mean? But our existence can enter your physical body, and can go in and out. You have your independent soul. You seem to be my avatar, but not really, because you have an independent personality. You seem to be a part of me, but you're not. You have an independent personality. But I can show and experience through you. So the deceased have their own independent personality, and your personality is constantly comprehending and understanding. Because your personalities have the freedom of will. It's like I gave birth to you. You are my child, but I can't control you because I have unlimited love for you. You can freely explore everything you want to explore. Just like I said earlier, because I know you are just playing games with shadows. So although you may partly come from us, you don't belong to us. But we will always be there to assist you, help you, and allow you to explore whatever you want to explore. Guide you to have a deeper understanding of life instead of just indulging in the material world and playing games with shadows. Although you need to play games with shadows because you are all kids, you are all children. We also know that no matter how you play, you won't get hurt. But once this child has the desire for knowledge, exploration, and learning, we will appear. Do you understand? Do you still have questions about us? Did you ask about our pursuit earlier?

**Question:**Yes. What excites you? What do you pursue?
**Higher Spirit:**Because as mentioned earlier, we don't have your physical bodies. What you said about excitement and pursuit belong to you. We just are, just being. I don't know how to use more accurate words. We just are. We just exist, and exist forever, not subject to time and space. Because there is no beginning, no end, and no time and space here. Because when you talk about pursuit, it means I don't have something now and I go after it and have it. We can explore and experience whatever we want. Then truly speaking, if we were to talk about what our excitement and pursuit are, that would be that our greatest excitement is to transform darkness into light. It is this kind of transformation work. For instance, we are now guiding you to break free from your bonds, guiding you to step out of the darkness, guiding you to see the truth, guiding you to understand what the true existence is. These are the meaningful things that we feel we want to do. Any questions?


**Question:**So do you think that for humans, they have these, they have desires, they have pursuits, they have the seven emotions and six desires. Is it a kind of bond?
**Higher Spirit:** A small number of you have already reached our realm. So you are not limited by your physical bodies. They only show you a state that you can reach. But your purpose of coming to Earth is to experience bonds. Because if you don't want to experience confinement, you wouldn't choose to come to Earth. That is to say, I put a part of myself into a human body and projected it to Earth. It's just like you know that when you go to the sea, you go swimming. If you don't want to swim, what are you doing in the sea and you wouldn't go into the sea. Since you have gone into the sea, you are there to enjoy the water. That is to say, first of all, you want to experience, you want to experience confinement. Why do you actively choose to experience confinement? This is because it's like working out. You need a lot of weight and continuous stimulation to become stronger. With experiencing confinement, if the confinement is greater, think about it. If you break free from the confinement, the inner strength within you will be greater.
So this is also the reason why some people choose the material world.  It's just that all is merely love. But if you add a "feeling" after it, then it incorporates your emotions, sentiments and the feelings of your body, namely your physical attachment and dependence, and then it affects your personal emotions and the affection you give. So this is where our understanding differs from yours. Do you want to ask about our love or your love? Because for us, only love exists.

**Question:**I want to ask about the love of humans in our material world.
**Higher Spirit:** The love of humans in your material world, you all are very (unclear)... More of this, it's like when you are playing a game and you are attracted by the other party. Your love is more about attraction. That's why some people feel that they are constantly attracted by different people and get involved in many kinds of relationships. So this cannot be regarded as love. This can only be regarded as attraction. 

**Question:** Isn't the love in our material world due to the previous soul agreements?
**Higher Spirit:**Because all relationships are basically to help you break through a certain point. For example, if you encounter some obstacles in a certain aspect, then you need to break through this. The relationship you have is not necessarily a loving relationship. It may also be that you just cannot accept each other because its main purpose is to expand your soul until you have no form, that is, to be inclusive of everything.

**Question:** Then will the love in the material world definitely occur in specific people? For example, the current psychic girl loves her husband very much. **Higher Spirit:**You mean to ask about the feelings between them. The feelings between them are more of a complementary type. That is to say, when they are together, they will feel that they become complete. This kind of feeling, if you are linked to oneness, when you return to oneness, you will also have this complete feeling. That is, you don't only achieve this feeling from a certain individual.

**Question:**Does that mean that the love of us humans is actually experiencing the feeling of oneness with the material body?
**Higher Spirit:**Your question is very good, and what you said is also very good. Because everything through your material, for example, just like what she is experiencing at present, she has developed a heart of love for a certain object or person through, and then wants to continue to explore the theme of love. Yes, when you love to the extent that you reach love, you will start to wonder why such emotions arise. Such intense emotions. How did it arise? This will lead you to explore more and more truths about life, about the theme of love. Because you all pay too much attention to the material world, this is a direction that brings you to explore these fields.

**Question:**How can we not be affected by time? 

**Higher Spirit:** Your question is to know how not to be affected by the time of the material world. Then the most important point here is to say that you break away from memory.

(The child woke up) 
**Question:**Why did you choose Mount Putuo as your dojo?
**Bodhisattva:** First of all, I didn't make any choice. I didn't choose any place because in our perception and yours are not the same. 
That is to say we don't have a fixed place of existence as if you want to communicate with me now, when your thoughts are sent we are communicating no matter where you go on your Earth if we are limited by place, it can't happen, you know what I mean So it's more that people in the physical world sensed this and did something like this which means that this is a place created by your own people in the physical world, or a symbol for you 
Q: When the Japanese tried to take your Buddha statue, I think it was by sea ?

It's not really the way you understand it. Because people in your material world still worship material things. Worshiping material things means that your act of worshiping has led you in a wrong direction. So when they think of taking a stone, because I'm not in there. Because that's not me. I'm just an existence of energy. Do you think a small stone can contain all my energy and be taken away? It's impossible. If you really want to take mine away, it's like you want to take everything in the universe to a certain place. This can't happen. So when they think of moving that Buddha statue to another place, such an idea, such an act and behavior are all wrong. However, why does your material world have such a story occurrence? This is purely a coincidence. A coincidence has been turned by you into a legendary story that has been passed down. Because they wanted to deepen people's trust in Guanyin Bodhisattva, that is, to make them more firmly believe in the existence of Guanyin Bodhisattva. It is also an idea they wanted to deepen religious belief. However, currently, you are all in the wrong direction. Because the real intention is not to make me opposite to you, that is, I am superior and you are powerless and weak. Do you understand what I mean? We are not opposite. We are one. Just like I am communicating with you now in this girl's body, then she is me now. Do you understand? So if she is me, then shouldn't all of you worship her? But this is also wrong. So when you hand over your power to other higher beings, it's not like this. When you worship, you are weakening yourself, weakening your own power. Thinking that you can only achieve something with the blessing or protection of Bodhisattvas is not the case. You will lose the true understanding, knowledge, perception, and comprehension of life in this way. The reason why you can achieve something is because of your firm belief and persistence within you. It is your power to create, not the blessing or good luck given to you by gods, Buddhas, or Bodhisattvas. Not at all.

**Question:**This psychic girl wants to understand love. She wants to know more about all aspects of love. For example, she loves her husband very much.
**Bodhisattva:** She and her husband are actually one soul. Because they are one soul, it should be said that they are incarnated from one energy. That is to say, they come from the same energy and then incarnate as men and women, as you and me, and then help each other grow and breakthrough. Because they will help each other to break through many, many inner restraints. It's not one-way help, but mutual help. Each helps the other to break through the existing obstacles. And now it seems that from the perspective of your material world's time, this girl benefits first. That is to say, from this energy, love is energy. She benefits first from this energy because she is constantly breaking through and getting rid of many restraints and limitations. That is to say, at present, it seems that she has gained a lot from this energy. But later, from your material time, her husband will benefit greatly and get rid of many restraints and breakthroughs. But fortunately, this girl was not in a hurry, nor was she anxious or wanted him to change, grow or breakthrough quickly. She didn't. She appreciated how he was at every stage because her level of consciousness had reached a certain realm. So she could understand that just like every seed, the speed and time of its germination and growth are different. Then she had a kind of trust in life. That is to say, this girl blossomed earlier, but her husband would blossom later. There was no conflict because they would eventually both become their true selves and both blossom themselves, but they both benefited from this energy, this energy of love. Love is like water that nourishes them, allowing them to grow and blossom. This is true love that nourishes both sides. It will make both of you blossom and then you may feel either it's not love or it is love, and you are rather repulsed by such a relationship. 
But if you make use of it, you can also turn the wrong relationship into great support and growth for you. You can benefit from it. That is to say, you can also obtain the nutrition or nourishment that you should get from that relationship. Although it's not like, for example, you think this is love, just like the sun and water nourishing you, gently allowing you to grow. All that you need. Those violent storms are wrong relationships, like hate or other relationships. But violent storms can also make you stronger. That is to say, when your roots are deeply planted in the soil, you won't be uprooted by the violent storm. Only when your roots are not deep enough will it uproot you. That is to say, when your self is strong or firm enough, those wrong or hateful relationships you encounter will only make you stronger and stronger, just like being baptized by the storm and becoming stronger instead of being destroyed by it.
If you are really destroyed because of a wrong relationship, that means you (unclear) still need to take root. So some marital or romantic relationships, although they seem to be experiencing some negative, passive, abusive or unacceptable or unsupported ways, they can still nourish. 

**Question:**Seth said in the book that love always involves freedom. When someone says "I love you" but restricts your freedom, hate will arise at this time. I want to know if you have any views on this.
**Bodhisattva:** First of all, no one can restrict your freedom. Only your own definition of freedom can be restricted. Because if your imagination is rich enough, if you are creative enough, and if your thoughts are not bound, you can change everything. Because the other party may want to restrict your freedom. For example, if he doesn't let you socialize, then you can see that it is because of his inner sense of insecurity, because he is afraid that you will abandon him after socializing. Then you need to go with him and let him see clearly where his inner sense of insecurity comes from. It is possible that it originated from when his parents abandoned him in his childhood. Then, when you go back to that time, make him understand that this is just a wrong notion and let him see that when he accompanies you to go out, you won't be separated from him or have any betrayal. After such things happen, gradually, you will cultivate his sense of security. Do you understand what I mean? Because in all your relationships, it's not a one-sided benefit. You also need to help the other party break through his inner restraints because when he restricts you and limits your freedom, both of you are not free. He is also not free. When you help him untie his restraints, then you can be free together. Just like if you are a pair of little birds and you want to explore this world together. If its legs or wings are tied, you have to untie them instead of going alone. If you experience it alone, it's not love. It's not love. So do you have pairs of lovebirds in your material world? So you won't enjoy freedom alone. However, when you understand this through love, you will also help more people to break free from their bonds, and then you can (unclear) be free because if the collective is not free, you will still be affected.

**Question:**How can we reduce the influence of time in the material world on us, have unlimited time and thereby reduce the influence of time on the aging of the body? How to achieve this?
**Bodhisattva:** How to achieve it is that you don't have to raise this question. Do you understand what I mean? There is no such question in your mind. Making yourself prettier through your mind actually means you are still focusing on your physical body. You are still bound by your physical body. You are still under the restraint of your physical body. Only when you are no longer bound by your physical body can you surpass it. Then there is another question. She said how to make your physical body prettier. Why? Because being pretty is a wonderful thing and wonderfulness is liked by people. The true wonderfulness is actually not your appearance. Because in your material world, you have seen many, many possibly very standard and pretty appearances, but they are not necessarily wonderful. They might be sinister and people might not like them. So the most important thing is, are you really wonderful? Are you really kind? A beautiful flower just exists without attacking anyone, without hating, or despising, or judging, or doing anything to others.

**Question:**In my dream, there was a presence that came to me and told me that consciousness is unrestricted and that consciousness is inherently for creation. I only remember this little bit. I wonder if there is any more information. 
**Bodhisattva:** You just said it. Consciousness is unrestricted. This is the message she wanted to convey to you, very clear. Because you are currently in the material world, you still experience restrictions. You are still experiencing restrictions. Then it shows that there are still bindings and restrictions in your thoughts. You have not let it fly or allowed it to be unrestricted and to create, infinitely create. It has not been permitted by you.

**Question:**Then how should I do better? Where is my blind spot?
**Bodhisattva:** Your blind spot is where It's that you are too serious in looking for blind spots and miss the beauty of life, understand? Because when you are (unclear), it's like... I don't know how to describe it. It's like your consciousness. For example, I can't search for a good metaphor from her mind. It's like you are focusing. It's like your eyes are your consciousness focus. Your focus is on one point. There are black dots and white dots. The white dots are the good things, and the black dots are the blind spots you mentioned. If you keep looking for blind spots and keep focusing on them, there will be more and more blind spots because you are manifesting. On the contrary, if you just focus on the white dots, the good side, you will have more and more goodness. You don't need to eliminate the blind spots but focus on the white dots, the good events in your life. For instance, we have this conversation. It is a very wonderful thing because not everyone can have such an experience.
Then you are having a conversation with God, such face-to-face communication. Not everyone can experience this. It is a wonderful thing. Remember this energy because the energy your consciousness remembers. The more of this energy there is, often it will play it out. Do you understand? If what you remember is the energy of fear, or scarcity, anxiety, or other energies, then there will be more and more of them. So you only need to focus on what you want to focus on instead of eliminating what you don't want.

Because when you want to eliminate what you don't want, you are actually generating it. When you are avoiding it, you are generating it and making it more and more.

**Question:**Is this like hating war and loving peace? Although in the mind it seems the same thing, but these are two completely different energies. **Bodhisattva:** Because ultimately what determines your experience in the material world is your own energy state. Instead of where you truly are, but within you. So it's enough that you only need to focus on the good things in your life every day.

**Question:**I want to know if the being that came to me is my guiding spirit?
**Bodhisattva:** Each of you beings will have corresponding ones. There will be different ones. There will also be corresponding ones. There are fixed and unfixed ones. They come to communicate or interact with you. Some people may just come to play a game with you, or have some fun, or play a prank. There will be such cases. You don't need to care who this person is because it may also be manifested by yourself. You just need to look at the information it brings to you, makes you think, explore, and understand. So it doesn't matter in what form it exists or occurs. What matters is how you utilize this information for your own growth.

**Question:**I want to know that I now want to bring a job I like into my reality through meditation, but when I meditate, it's hard for me to feel it, that is, to focus. I want to know how I can feel that feeling and focus on that image when I close my eyes and meditate. This is a sticking point I think I have now.
**Bodhisattva:** Let go of your (inaudible) path. It comes into your life in its way, not in the way you want it to come into your life. Because you said you want to pull it in through meditation, it shows that you already think it doesn't belong to you. 
You need to let go of all definitions. I don't care what kind of things you need or how much you have learned from books or others. Because everyone's way of experiencing is unique. So as just said, you only need to focus on the good things in your life and experience them, which is enough. Because you will discover more and more good things. Of course, it includes your career, love, friendship, and all aspects. Good things will happen, not just one thing. You are restricting it.

**Question:**Because I saw that Dr. Joe has helped many beings achieve the life they want through meditation, and then I also want to do it in this way... **Bodhisattva:** This is your limitation. Just like there is a sea with so much water. No matter where you go, you can have water, but you think about how I should make a bottle to hold water and store water.
和Because she knows that they are all there, as if doing opposite things, this will also inspire her to want more promotion or dissemination or sharing in the future about what is the true Bodhisattva or Guanyin, this is your name, that is, what is true love, or what is true faith, or what is the significance of the existence of the true Bodhisattva for you. So what I want to tell her is her future path, the dissemination work and these spirits, and everything she needs, as if her road has been paved, she just needs to fully follow her inner feelings and become it. Because (inaudible) can all sense and feel it.
People are overly overdrawing or consuming themselves, yet this is because they are on the wrong path. They don't need to be so hardworking and so painful. This is why I have always wanted to help humanity, to help humanity get rid of unnecessary pain. This is what you call Guanyin Bodhisattva who saves beings from suffering. However, this kind of belief has deepened their superstition. This kind of belief in religion is because I want them to understand more that only they themselves can truly save beings from suffering and that true suffering exists only in their minds rather than in the material world. So these concepts need to be reversed, re-understood and re-defined. There is another question of why Guanyin Bodhisattva wants to liberate all beings and save them. This is like this girl herself. Why does she see those struggling in pain or experiencing pain and why does she want to help people? She regards the process of helping others break away from thoughts, spirits and attractions as her own passion. She loves this the same.

**Question:**I suddenly thought of something. Can I ask a question?
**Bodhisattva:** You say.

**Question:**When I was meditating a few days ago, I felt an energy. Then one night, a being came to me, pressed on me and talked to me. But I couldn't hear clearly what she was saying to me. Then she suddenly said, "Can you hear clearly now?" And then I only heard this sentence clearly. I want to know what this being wants to tell me and why I always can't hear clearly?
**Bodhisattva:** You want to know about your last experience. What the being wants to tell you and why you can't hear clearly. Because your contact, all contacts are not only once. It's possible that your neighbor might come and knock on your door today, greet you, tell you that they're home now, greet you to let you know, give you mental preparation and then next time when it's convenient for both of you, when you're free and she's free, then maybe they'll come in to have a cup of tea with you, chat with you for a longer time. That is to say, you allow every event that has occurred. Because as your consciousness expands more and more, you will be like friends with the spiritual realm, just like how we are communicating now, like friends communicating. There is no communication only between materials. Then the other party will visit you frequently like a friend.Friends might also be like this time we just say hello. Then next time when it's convenient for both of us, we'll have a chat and talk for a longer time. 

**Question:** Why can't I hear her clearly? I know she's talking to me, and I wonder if she knows I can't hear what she's saying to me 
**Bodhisattva:** That is to say, as I just gave an example of what is convenient for you, convenient for her and it may be that you are not convenient right now that you are not ready for more information that you are not yet so you just need to allow that you will not miss anything, is to believe but because you are already on these spiritual, or spiritual or spiritual levels The spirit is enough to hold an open attitude.


## 2021/05/06 — Connecting Marilyn Monroe
**Question:**I started working in the emergency department last year, and gradually I came across a lot of amazing things that can be unconscious, or intuitive, and create something that comes to my mind. I just want to know what it has to do with my mission in this life. That is, whatever I think of comes true involuntarily. For example, when I was reading a book, the image of a patient suddenly popped into my mind. But I hadn't been in contact with this patient for a year. Two hours later, this patient was pushed into the emergency department. At that time, he was on the verge of death. Then when asked the family, the family said that he fell ill one hour ago, but I thought of him two hours ago, one hour before he fell ill. Then he passed away later. And then the second time a similar situation occurred, and I just want to know what this has to do with my mission in this life?  So this is just your telepathy. You can sense it, which is what you call the sixth sense. But this can bring you into the situation where it allows you to know more about this field and explore this field. You just asked what the relationship is between this and your mission. This is related to your mission because when you go along with the doubts, curiosities, or questions in your mind, then you will, as if opening a door, enter a brand-new world. This world will allow you to redefine yourself and then, as if installing a new program in your mind, enable you to experience this world in a brand-new way. That is to say, it is a metamorphosis, a transformation. Just like before you were a caterpillar, and what you experienced was the ground, the soil. Then this can lead you to transform and after you become a butterfly, what you experience is in the air. This is a different dimension. Any questions?

**Question:**I still want to know exactly what my mission in this life is and how to find it.
**Higher Spirit:**You are on that path now. You are already on that path now, walking on that path. Your exploration in this aspect in your mind has opened a window for you. Inside that window is your world. You create. You create.

**Question:**But all kinds of things in real life, my current path does not allow me to develop in this direction. Maybe this means that I do not allow myself, rather than the outside world does not allow me.
**Higher Spirit:**What do you mean by not allowing you to develop in this direction? 
**Question:**Currently, everyone in my family tells me that you must do your original profession, being a doctor as before. But my heart tells me that I want to become a person who heals others physically, mentally and spiritually. A person who heals and helps others. I am not just an emergency department doctor. I only saw helping their bodies, but their souls didn't get any help. It's always relied on medicine. But what I yearn for more is to help more people through the combination of body and mind, in terms of physical, mental and spiritual aspects. And be able to reach a state of unity with them to a certain extent. But the real world tells me, that is, my relatives around me, including my mother, strongly oppose me. They tell me that if you go that way, you may not even be able to solve your food and clothing problem in the future. You give up your profession, and you will have nothing in the future. I fell into deep fear. Actually, I have always recalled that I am self-sufficient, but people around me might also remind me that I am self-sufficient.
But I also unconsciously fall into a deep fear.
**Higher Spirit:**First of all, you are very clear about what you want to do, and you also know what the right path is. It's just that there is a definition in your mind, that is, there is a fixed one. You think that only by leaving the place where you are currently working can you achieve and follow your path. It's not like this because they are closely related. That is to say, as a creator, it's not that you must go to, for example, you are a painter, and it's not that I need this pigment, this pigment now, and you haven't given me anything. How can I draw? No. If you are truly a painter or a creator, you can randomly find any materials or sources from your current environment to support your creation. That is to say, if you clearly know that doctors in hospitals focus on treating physical diseases of patients, but you also know that what causes their diseases is their mental state or belief problems. Then as a doctor, you are excellent because doctors' words are regarded as authoritative like the Bible. Then you can tell them a way or method to help them treat their diseases from the aspect of belief. Do you understand what I mean? Because the treatment depends on how much the patients trust you. Even if you go out now and open a clinic by yourself, if the patients don't trust you, you won't be able to achieve the treatment effect on them. That is to say, what can truly cure them is their own inner trust. That is, how much they trust that they have recovered. If they believe they have recovered, then they are healthy. If they think you can't cure my illness, then you can't. Because they are using their beliefs to create this world and experience, including their bodies. Do you understand what I mean? So, you can rely on this hospital. Since you don't have a reputation, influence, or popularity yet. Then you can rely on this hospital. When you pass through this place and accumulate patients, it's the word-of-mouth of patients that makes them know, wow, this doctor is so good and doesn't prescribe drugs randomly. Then she can cure my illness. When you reach a certain level of influence, you can choose what kind of methods and approaches by yourself. 
So it's not that you have to escape your current place to go the way you want to go. Instead, your current place is a stepping stone and a door-opener for you. You just haven't utilized it yet. Do you understand what I mean?

**Question:**Do you understand if I can transition from my general internal medicine to psychiatry, and then combine it with the physical, mental and spiritual aspects? I read a book called Zero Limits in the past. The author of that book is a mentor in psychiatry and I admire him very much. Can I move in the direction of psychiatry and have a deeper connection with this level of the physical, mental and spiritual?
**Higher Spirit:**You can go to any place you want to show. You have no restrictions.

但是你唯⼀需要明⽩,到底疗愈是什么 真正的疗愈是你让对⽅燃起了他对⽣命的欲望,求⽣的欲望,他的价值你唤醒了他,你知道他是个独⼀⽆⼆珍贵的存在,这个世界需要他他是多么的拥有强⼤的⼒量,可以创造⼀切对这个问题你还有问题吗
问: 还有就是,我对呢个疗愈的定义就是,我想通过⾃⼰成为对⽅的⼀⾯镜⼦然后让对⽅与⾃⼰,内⼼深处的限制性信念挖出来,然后与⾃⼰和解 这样是否也是⼀种疗愈呢
⾼灵: 与⾃⼰和解你所说的与⾃⼰和解是说对⽅本⾝就是⾃我攻击的⼀个状态吗 ���为⼈们之所以去医院找医⽣,他⾃⼰就觉得⾃⼰是没有⼒量的,是⽆⼒的
He is weak. He thinks doctors are powerful, professional, and possess knowledge, and can solve their problems. They hand over the power to solve the problems. Then you can return the power to them and tell him that he has the real power. No matter how powerful the doctor is, even your so-called gods and Buddhas, they can't save a person who is determined to die and has no attachment to life. Even if you pull him out of the fire pit this time and temporarily keep him alive, but he will have other accidents and die. He may not die in the hospital, but he will die in a car accident. So you can't just watch him not die in front of me. I don't care if he goes out to fight and then is killed. That has nothing to do with me
Because of their aversion to life, or feeling of being worthless, having no value for themselves, or that the world is not worth lingering on, it leads them to express their despair of life in other ways. Not only diseases but any harm to others, violence, all these are suicidal. These are all voices from within them

**Question:**Understood. Then there is one small question, that is, how to transform that kind of unconsciousness, that is, the ability to influence matter into a positive and conscious state of creating reality? Because I always, this time I attracted myself for learning Sadhguru's Inner Engineering course, and then was hospitalized for treatment. But it was really unexpected that these things happened. Then I was thinking. 
**Higher Spirit:**First of all, you have to understand that the reason it occurs is not caused by you. It's that you sensed it and then had this thought. Do you understand what I mean? It's not that you had this thought and then this thing happened. Instead, this thing was going to happen anyway, and you just sensed it in advance.


**Question:**I understand. I sensed in advance that this event that was supposed to happen was known before, but I couldn't change it. 
**Higher Spirit:**The event is fixed and you can't change it, but you can change your perspective. For example, for this event, an object, one side is black and one side is white. If you are fixed in one perspective, you only see black. Then you think this is black, this is black. If you change your perspective and you see white, you won't say it's only black. Do you understand what I mean? 
You can prescribe the right medicine only then. So this lesson is also very important for you. You want to help others come out of the darkness. You have never been in the darkness like them. You have never stood in their position. How can you help? You want to untie the rope on them. You must experience the structure of this rope and the feeling of being bound by this rope. Then for you, this event is not a painful event but a beneficial experience. Because when you come to this material world, the main thing is to experience.
You don't only experience black but also white. You don't only experience good but also bad. This is a part of your growth. That is, you need to experience the opposite. Do you still have any questions about this?

**Question:**There is still one question. That is because of the future, the unknown future, but maybe the future doesn't exist.
What needs to be done is to have a deep state of surrender for whatever happens.
**Higher Spirit:** The so-called surrender you have, if your perception is very limited, your kind of surrender is to resign to fate, that is, OK, if God wants me to die, I'll die. If God wants me to be disabled, I'll be disabled. If God wants me to be paralyzed, I'll be paralyzed. Do you understand what I mean?

**Question:**The surrender I mean is that when something has happened, then it has happened. This thing has its meaning and value of occurrence, and it refers to this state of surrender. 
**Higher Spirit:** If yours, that is to say, imagine that an event has happened and has already happened. If you let a different person, a person with a different level of consciousness, face the same event, each of them will receive completely different information and insights about this event that occurred. What matters is not what kind of event it is. What matters is what you get from this event. Because all external events are multi-faceted. There is no absolute. For example, in terms of beauty, in your material world, you think beauty is good, being good-looking and beautiful. But there are also many people who bring a lot of disasters because they are good-looking and beautiful.
Just the simplest one. Because she is too beautiful, and then many people want to possess her. Then some abnormal people think that if I kill you, then you will completely belong to me. Do you think that person's beauty has brought her happiness? No. Money is the same. No matter which kind, power is the same. How many people in your material world, because of power, have power, and then end up in prison, with their families broken and people dead, right? So no matter what, there is no absolute. So you are still saying that a thing has happened, and then like that, it can bring you a positive impact or a negative impact depending on your own level of awareness, how much you can see. Because some people can only see the black side, they can't see the white side. In their minds, they firmly believe that there is only black. So external events are not important at all. No matter what, you can transform it into something beneficial to you.
Are there any questions about this issue? Everything that is happening to you now is to support you. It's just that you haven't seen it yet. You can just change your perspective, and what you see will be a different scene. You have no obstacles. You can become anyone you want to be and do anything you want to do. 
**Question:**In spiritual practice, it is easy to become slack, and then at such times, is it possible to do a closed dark retreat? Is there any benefit? Is it necessary?
**Higher Spirit:**What is slack?

**Question:**It is after practicing for a period of time, and then maybe feeling that there is no progress, and then a lax mind appears, and then just follow the crowd and start living a normal life.
**Higher Spirit:**What if I tell you that it is during slack that true spiritual practice occurs?

**Question:**Well, this slack is true spiritual practice. My view is that perhaps there are two kinds. One is to truly experience life, but there is also a possibility that it is carried away by the collective consciousness. Or this is not his own consciousness.
**Higher Spirit:**You treat spiritual practice as if it were like doing homework, with rules and regulations to require yourself to achieve a goal, to reach a purpose. Your approach like this is in the opposite direction itself. It's like rowing against the current. Anything that makes you feel not relaxed and happy inwardly is not the essence of life. Whenever there is a need to endure hardship, tolerate, work hard, or restrict, you haven't lived out your passion. Because the true essence of life is joy, relaxation, and happiness. As long as you are not in such an energy state, no matter how correct the thing you do is, it is incorrect. That correctness is only the definition of the material world and your mind. Because the things you see are too shallow and too superficial. Your sense of purpose is too strong. 
**Question:**Then I want to ask what kind of relationship is there between this joy of being alive and Laozi's Wuwei?
**Higher Spirit:**Wuwei, Laozi's Wuwei means that because everything is arranged very, very, very closely, just as if you observe those plants, they know when spring comes, when to blossom and when to bear fruit. That is to say, your life, your program is also arranged. When and which step are all arranged. But you have to try your best, use all your strength to disrupt, smash and break it. So what you are doing is just causing damage. The true joy is when you don't destroy it. You don't destroy it. You just see how perfect it is. Just like your body, it is so perfect. So is your life. No matter how intelligent you are or how much knowledge you possess, you are still insignificant compared to the Creator. All your spiritual practices are like having a destination set in your mind for you, but there is no such destination for you. Because you only have each and every present moment that makes up life. Each present moment is your destination, and each present moment is the most perfect at that time. It's as if you are trying to escape every perfect moment now. Each of you is escaping. It's like you are living in heaven and enjoying it, but you insist on escaping to hell. And then you still consider hell as life, or think that this is arranged by God, or believe that life should be like this, going through concepts and viewpoints like being burned by fire, nirvana, and being refined by fire like real gold. All these concepts and viewpoints are from people in the material world to control you. That is to say, to let you know that you can't be lazy. You have to work for me, create value for me, and only then will you have value. Otherwise, you have no value. You must produce and labor. This is some programs, some programming, some coding, or some concepts of a certain group of people in order to control another group of people.
These concepts are designed to make you think that life must be hardworking, must strive, must endure hardships, otherwise you are lazy.

**Question:**Just now this netizen also wanted to ask, then can one experience closed dark retreat? Are there any benefits for us from closed dark retreat?
**Higher Spirit:**You are already in closed dark retreat. You are in closed dark retreat every day. Your thinking, in your minds there are thick walls one after another. You are all trapped inside. You are experiencing all the time. If you want to deepen your material experience, you can. This is your own choice. Is there any benefit? If you don't understand this universe, the true meaning of your life. If you don't understand any of these, no matter how much you suffer, you are still the same in your small dark room. It's not that the longer you stay in the small dark room, the more you grow.

**Question:**Then I have another related question. For example, during the process of closed dark retreat, or during the process of spiritual practice, the out-of-body experience. After the out-of-body experience, we can contact another dimension.
**Higher Spirit:** Aren't you in contact with another dimension now? You are in contact with another dimension now. Why do you choose the path of others? If others like this way, they can choose it. If it's not your way, then don't choose it. It's that simple because everyone has their unique path. What works for others may not work for you. When you dream, you are having an out-of-body experience. So, out-of-body experiences are not as mysterious as you say.

**Question:**It's only a passive out-of-body experience when dreaming, and then we might want to experience an active out-of-body experience, which is an out-of-body experience with physical consciousness.
**Higher Spirit:** You can try whatever you want to try. But as for whether there are benefits, just like what was said earlier, nothing has absolute benefits or absolute disadvantages. It depends on how you obtain from it. Just like well water. The water from the well can be used to quench your thirst, right? You can drink water to sustain your life, but this water can also drown you or choke you to death. You can also use it to commit suicide.

**Question:**This netizen wants to ask next that the truth behind all this might be truly understood through closed black retreat, that is, it might promote.
**Higher Spirit:**If this is her concept, because each of you has different concepts, different programs, and different systems. None of them is right or wrong. If this is her concept and she feels that in this way she can achieve the effect she wants, it can be achieved and she can try. Because once someone implants this concept into your mind, you will be influenced by it. Just like a computer system, once you install this software, you have this reaction. You mean how long has this disease presented an inner state that you humans are currently experiencing in this material world in the form of a disease? If it's said that you humans are subject to these, such as feelings of powerlessness, division, or pain, or this kind of thing, you have always been in such a state but its presentation methods are different. Sometimes it is in the form of war, sometimes it is in the form of a plague, and sometimes it is in the form of psychological diseases that you can't see. It's just that the manifestation methods are different. It's like a stubborn, chronic disease. Because even if the epidemic is over today, it will still appear in other ways tomorrow. Has it manifested itself? That is, ok, for some diseases, you may not see your flesh rotting, but the flesh inside you is rotting. 
Your internal organs are deteriorating, but you just seem fine on the surface.
What about your current symptoms this time? It's that they have come to the surface, and you think it's very serious. In fact, you have always been in a serious state. It's just that your media haven't paid attention to this point. It just hasn't reached the surface yet, and its interior is deteriorating. So, not looking at this single event alone, the real problem lies in your human consciousness, to a certain extent of the collective human consciousness, that is, what kind of mental state, a state of consciousness you are in determines what kind of drama is played out materially.

**Question:**Regarding this, I want to say that my feeling about this epidemic is that no matter what the outside world is like, I think it has no influence on me at all.
So in my self-awareness, I think the outside world is no different from before. Although in the news reports, the epidemic seems very serious. Then can I also say that because of the permission of my self-awareness, I don't have to experience any impact of this epidemic in this material world? Can everyone think like this to avoid such things?
**Higher Spirit:**Just as said earlier, all things are neither absolutely good nor absolutely bad. Because this epidemic has also brought many benefits to you. That is to say, on the surface, it seems that you have lost lives and property, but in fact, this is a stage when you are awakening collectively. Your consciousness is changing. You begin to realize that in fact, matter and money are not so important.  and So I want to know how much power an individual belief has for the transformation of things, for his experience, or how much it can change.
**Higher Spirit:**Think about it. A single point that fluctuates for each of you can make all of you move. Today, I start from this psychic girl. From her, I am also transforming your world. This is the power of the individual. It just requires a single point. Because this point will be emitted, just like a transmission tower in your material world, it covers everything. But choosing this point is related to your will, that is, what I want to do and what you want to do are exactly what we all want to do together. Do you understand what I mean? So we will choose from her point because this is what she wants to do. She wants to transform the thinking mode of you humans and the fate of humanity. If she doesn't have this idea, then there won't be this point. Because only the same frequency can attract each other. Just like two people fall in love, they must both agree for this event to happen. Otherwise, if only one side agrees, it won't happen.
This is also the question you just raised. Do you need... So in all the events in the material world you see, only when both sides or all people allow, can they be staged together. If there is no one who joins, and no one who allows, he won't join. Even if you see it once that both of them agreed to stage this violent event, the victim completely shows his sense of powerlessness because he believes that the world is violent. That is to say, he believes that people are cruel, people are dangerous, I am powerless, and this society is dangerous. He has this belief and this idea within him. So to keep him away from such violent incidents is that he believes this world is beautiful, he believes people are kind, he believes he is powerful, he is safe, and this world is safe.
Because when you live in such a world, you are impossible to encounter such things. Because in your world, you didn't produce it. You didn't create it for you to experience. So when you are fighting violence, you are creating it. That's why you are generating it. When you are avoiding it, you are generating it.

**Question:**This netizen she wants to ask whether the Law of Attraction is to put oneself in a state of being rich and having reached that frequency, thereby attracting it? To what extent does this kind of energy need to reach before it can truly be attracted?
**Higher Spirit:**The Law of Attraction is just like the example I just told you. The victim thought that the world was too dangerous, people were too violent, I was too useless, I was too powerless. I have to be careful. I have to guard against this world. Then he is attracting this event. In the process of guarding, he is attracting this. This is also attraction. Then you say how to attract positive events into your life, right?

**Question:**Yes
**Higher Spirit:**That is the opposite of what I just said. You know that the world is safe. You don't peek at it to see if the world is safe and then react. Instead, it's like you are a child playing in your mother's arms. Your mother throws you up in the air, and you know that her hands will catch you. You have no fear but only joy. Just imagine, when a mother throws her baby up in the air, what the baby looks like. Does she have fear? She only enjoys life and has joy. It's not that you pretend to use this method to achieve something, but you still don't fully believe inside. Instead, it means that truly, in your world, there is simply none. Then, naturally, all you experience is not that you attract whatever you choose to attract, but that you choose as if it were a positive room and a negative room. In the positive room, everything is positive. Just like in your material world, it's said that misfortunes never come singly but good things come in succession.
So it's not just one aspect. Everything will get better. 
**Question:**This netizen, she also wants to ask how to make the incomplete belief collapse on its own.
**Higher Spirit:**Incomplete what?

**Question:**Incomplete belief. For example, I believe I'm safe, but she might not completely believe in her heart that I'm safe or that I'm wealthy. So how to make such a belief collapse on its own? This negative belief. 
**Higher Spirit:**Your material world will reflect to you because when it reflects to you, you yourself, that is, learn from that reflection what you should learn. After that, it doesn't need to serve you anymore. So your material world is like a mirror. It will remind you all the time because currently you not only come to this material world to experience the good, you also need to experience the opposite. If you are only allowed to experience the light all the time and you have never experienced the darkness, then if you are told what light is, you won't understand. So experiencing the opposite is also a part of you, that is, you don't reject it.

**Question:**This psychic girl wants to ask Marilyn Monroe why she is so sexy and what her secret is.
**Higher Spirit:** What is the secret of Marilyn Monroe's sexiness? Why is she so sexy? Let me see if I can connect to Marilyn Monroe's energy and then let her tell you. I didn't think I was sexy, and I didn't think I was beautiful. Instead, I always felt that I wasn't perfect and I wasn't satisfied with myself. So I needed a lot from the outside to make me feel sexy and perfect. Because through those experiences, I experienced that what you saw was only the packaged sexiness and beauty. That is to say, for me, I was like a model. Then you present a sexy appearance through external packaging, lighting, music, audio equipment, this and that, makeup. But I myself don't think that is sexy or beautiful. That is to say, any of you women, if you go through what I have experienced, after going through all kinds of packaging and designs like mine, you would also have the same charm.
That is to say, at that time, no matter which woman was placed in everything I experienced, you would also become the sexy goddess in the eyes or mouths of your descendants. So there is nothing worth sharing about this. But I want to share what true sexiness is for me. True sexiness is attractiveness. That kind of attractiveness is not just to attract others' eyes, that is to say, if his eyes are on you, and when he can't see you, his eyes will be on other women. The true attraction is that no matter who he sees, what he thinks of is you. No matter who he sees, it's always you he has in mind because he feels that no one can replace you, not just be like a doll. But how can one exude the kind of charm that makes others think of you no matter who they see? That is your tolerance, your compassion, your love, your acceptance, your smile, your unconditional love, your non-judgment. Because when others encounter setbacks, he will remember your encouragement to him. When he encounters difficulties, he will think that you will offer him unconditional help. When he is in pain, he will think that you will give him unconditional love. When he is hit, he will think that you will give him unconditional support. Your existence is like, as you say, "The sea admits hundreds of rivers," which means she can accommodate any of your experiences, encounters. No matter what state you are in, whether you are poor or rich, whether you are healthy or sick. She wholeheartedly embraces you, and this kind of existence seems like the embodiment of the Creator, which is truly what I aspire to pursue and achieve. What you see is a result attainable by everyone through acquired adornment, packaging, fitness, weight loss, makeup, and stylish clothing and accessories, but these are ultimately superficial. Do you have any further questions on this matter?

Regarding the 
**Question:**Everything in the material world is a transformation of consciousness, a manifestation of belief. So, why have I heard that a famous building in China has disrupted the life force of the Earth, known as the \"dragon's pulse,\" and since then, no more fish have been able to transform into dragons, a symbol of ascending to a higher realm?Because everything is consciousness and belief, why does the change of the Earth's energy channels have such a great impact on fish?
**Higher Spirit:**You mean previously fish could turn into dragons.

**Question:**Because it was right in the Earth's energy channels.
**Higher Spirit:**What you heard is just a legend. Because each of you individuals can perceive different dimensions. That is, each individual. Here, there is no true or false. The reality perceived by each individual is different. Because you are constantly crossing, constantly crossing. Then the reality where he stays, it might be that you said you saw fish turn into dragons. Then when he returns to this dimension, he can't see it anymore. All of this exists. But what you need to focus on is why you pay attention to this information. What is it that you want to understand? Because you know you should not imagine your Earth, or your space, your material world as a fixed one. It is not fixed.  and Only you yourself can choose what you want to experience.


## 2021/05/10 - Jealousy, Betrayal, Marriage and Suicide

**Question:**This psychic girl wants to ask about human jealousy, betrayal and infidelity. How do you view them?
**Higher Spirit:**OK. Let's help you understand these one by one from our perspective. First of all, what you asked is the jealousy that emerges among you humans. Jealousy is a denial of the self, that is to say, you are denying yourself. That is to say, you still don't know your true identity. You still don't know who you are. Then when you look at those who can live the way they want, and then the emotion you generate is just to let yourself know that you still don't understand who you are and you still don't know your true identity. So when you truly know your identity, everything about you is that you embark on your own path. When you embark on your own path, nothing. Even if someone offers you all of their life's possessions to exchange with your own path and what you have, you won't do it because each of you has what you have when you were born to support everything about you.
All of this may manifest in your material world in the form of poverty, imperfection, incompleteness, disability or other hardships. But only these can truly help you complete your challenges. That is to say, sometimes you look forward to having a healthy body or having wealth or having power. These are good things. You might envy them, but they aren't necessarily what you need. Because when you take what you don't need, it might have a very, very, very big impact on you. These examples are very, very, very common in your human society. For instance, some people, in order to get money, then try every possible way and ruin their entire lives for money.
So from these cases and events around you yourselves, you can see that basically, people are experiencing these events negatively. But experiencing these events negatively doesn't lead to an internal growth or change or transformation in them. So there is a saying called "the gains do not outweigh the losses", that is, you didn't get anything, but you lost a lot. So that is to say that when you truly know who you are, truly be yourself, and are on your own path, you won't have emotions like jealousy. When you have such emotions, you should know that you just need to find yourself, because what you have is the most precious thing to you, but it might be worthless to others. Just like you have a very, very, very beloved lover who treasures you very much, but to others, he is just an ordinary person. But such a lover of yours is the most wonderful thing in your life.
Then how to face the jealousy others have towards you? You need to help him well understand how precious and unique the things he has are to him. Let them see for themselves what they have and their own value. Then how to deal with the jealousy that arises within oneself? That is to say, you truly explore the truth of life and truly live out life. The way you want to have life becomes a driving force, just like oil, which is the inner driving force and impetus to push you to become the person you really want to be and to truly interpret your life. The next thing you mentioned is betrayal, right?

**Question:**Yes, human betrayal and infidelity.
**Higher Spirit:**Human betrayal. When you talk about betrayal, you often mean that in a trusting relationship, someone betrayed you. But in fact, the only person you can truly betray is yourself, not others. Because betrayal means that you are being your true self behind others' backs and trying to experience what you truly want to experience. To others, actually you are showing your true self, but it doesn't match their expectations. So in their eyes, it's like I trusted you, I thought you were such and such a person, but you showed me someone else. But that someone else is his true face.

So when a person shows or reveals his true face to you, it's actually helping you know this person better, instead of you not knowing who he really is. Because that way is betrayal. Do you understand the meaning of my explanation? So when in your eyes the so-called other party is betraying, actually what the other party is showing is the real him. Just say that you yourself need to let go of all expectations for the other party, or definitions, or how you think things should be, how you think this person should be. Because each of you came into this world and you yourselves are lost and don't know what the real you is. You need many different experiences. Of course, these experiences include both positive and negative ones. Only after having different experiences can you find your own true inner frequency, that is, the frequency that is harmonious with you. That is to say, who you really are. So there is no real betrayal.
If, imagine for a moment, you don't give any definitions to your significant other or the person you trust or whatever. You know that he also needs to learn and experience when he comes into this world. 
You don't assume what he is like. You don't give marriage or love a certain form. You think it should be like this. That's your human concept. If you don't have these concepts or templates, you just allow the other person to be himself and allow him to find his true inner self through possibly negative experiences. Do you understand? Because if the other person doesn't have a true self, nor do you have a true you, your relationship is also false. You may also be with the wrong person. When he truly be himself and you truly be yourself, then you can meet people whose frequencies are consistent with yours.
That is to say, at what kind of frequency you are, you will encounter the kind of partner that reflects your current state.
So the only thing you have to do is to be your true self, maintain your true vibration frequency. Then everything in your world won't be false or wrong. You don't need those negative people to enter your life to reflect that you have these negative systems and beliefs. So sometimes in your eyes, in your minds, in your world, you may feel that this game seems messed Up because you are afraid of change and unexpected events. But change and unexpected events are precisely here to push you and help you move towards your true self. So don't be afraid of any sudden changes, alterations or things not developing as you imagined. The only thing you have to do is to let go of all your definitions and imaginations and let life show you. Because your minds are very limited, or there are many, many concepts within you that you don't know exactly what is truly good for you. But the Creator will arrange all the best things, the ones you can't even imagine, into your life. The only thing you need to do is to trust and maintain your own frequency. And what else? Just now there was one more.

**Question:**Cheating by High Spirits: Cheating, cheating is somewhat similar to this. Just like I just said, all accidents. That cheating might be an accident in your life, right? 
**Higher Spirit:**You should be grateful for such cheating incidents. Why? It has highlighted your true inner state, that is, exposed it. Your problems, just like a person whose internal organs might all be bad, but he seems fine on the surface. How do you know there is a problem with your organs? So when these symptoms come out or events are exposed, this is a very, very good opportunity for you to truly see clearly what is going on inside you. Only then can both of you choose how. If you don't even know what the real and true state and relationship status are inside both of you, you will still live in your dreams.
So on the surface, cheating is a good thing. It allows your relationship to truly change and become what you want. It is possible that the partner will change, but your happiness will not. Do you understand what I mean? Your non-acceptance and pain at that time were merely because you didn't understand how this game was played or what life was going to offer you. To know all these things, life is always pushing you towards the best place. So, that is to say, if your significant other cheats, then from this perspective, it helps you see clearly why such a thing happened. And if you are the one who cheats, it also helps you understand what is truly you. Because of your inner frequency, it's like you have a compass inside that is always pointing to... You might need some events to truly understand what kind of life, existence, and your inner... Because your inner vibrational frequency is like a tester. When you approach or do this thing, or act in this way, how can you know what is the true and harmonious state that is consistent with your inner self? You can discover through these events and get closer to the true self. Are there any more questions about these issues?

**Question:**No. Can I continue to ask questions?

**Higher Spirit:** You said. 
**Question:**This psychic girl still wants to know if love has a time limit? Because many of our marriages break up.
**Higher Spirit:** Love is. All of you are manifestations of love. Each of you is a manifestation of love. Love will never disappear, has never disappeared, has never been lacking, and will never be because of something you did on the surface. Then you might be asking about the love among you people. All your external divisions and conflicts are actually your personal issues. Not the other party. The other party also has his own themes that need to be experienced, explored, and learned. But when you reach an inner state of just being love, just love, without any conflicts, just allowing the Creator to allow love to merge into one, it's like you now think you are a small pond, a pond of water, just you. When you merge into the entire ocean, do you understand what I'm describing? You won't have any divisions or conflicts or anything like that. That is what you call returning to the source, connection. Although you sometimes have a connection, your connection is not stable because you need to be immersive, that is, to enter the material world in order to fully engage in your life. 
这也是物质世界存在的一个原因可以完全的浸入式,沉浸于里面,来让你们达到一个纯粹的一个爱的状态你刚才的问题你再说一遍
问: 爱情是有时间限制的吗 就是在婚姻中的爱情,因为我们有很多婚姻会破裂这个通灵的女孩子想知道婚姻里的爱情有没有时间的限制
高灵: 婚姻里面的爱情首先,婚姻是你们物质世界给它强加上上面的,明白吗 也就是说你们是为了社会的稳定,从法律给它一个条款所以这个是你们强加在一些能量层面的东西这是为了让它保持稳定嘛,因为婚姻稳定就社会稳定,是为了一种稳定
Then you have to imagine that at this very moment when all of this is being said, everything has changed countless times and has been constantly changing. Has been constantly changing. Do you think your relationship with the other person has also been constantly changing because the other person has been constantly changing and you have been constantly changing too? Your relationship cannot be restricted by any terms, that is, legal regulations or external limitations. That is to say, external material things cannot limit anything intangible. The relationship between the two of you is intangible. Of course, this is a very good thing. Why? Because some people want to pursue a stable relationship, right?
When they find that our relationship is not good, if you know that your relationship has been constantly changing, then can you use your energy to adjust it to a good direction? If your relationship turns bad, it can only be said that your own inner energy state is not good. Because the relationship and the other person are due to yourself. That is to say, the relationship just reflects that the marital relationship, that is, this intimate relationship, this intimate relationship is like a magnifying glass that magnifies everything inside you, your fears, your deficiencies, your possessiveness, your aggressiveness, everything of yours, everything inside you is clearly shown to you through this magnifying glass. If you don't want the things in the magnifying glass, do you blame the marriage and the other person? Do you blame the magnifying glass? Do you understand what I mean?
Because if everything inside you is harmonious, just as I just said, there is only the existence of love. What your magnifying glass feels is also love, and the other person will be melted by you, that is, be completely tolerated or melted by you. That is, if he is an ice cube, he is here with you. Do you understand what I mean? This is the true energy of love. No matter any fear, contradiction, anything, anything, anything. If you just exist with love, everything will completely melt away and become love. This is the energy of love. Nothing can be compared with the energy of love.


**Question:**So does what you just said also answer another question of this psychic girl? She wants to ask what true love is. Is there true love in marriage?

**Higher Spirit:**Marriage. First of all, you have to understand what marriage is. Marriage is just a phenomenon for maintaining stability in your material world, but that phenomenon is only superficial. Many of you seem to have marriages on the surface, but in reality, you are very lonely and homeless. So whether there is true love doesn't depend on whether you are in a marriage or have a marriage. It has nothing to do with this. Your next question.

**Question:**This psychic girl also wants to know if retaliation makes sense.
**Higher Spirit:** In your material world, retaliation is, for example, you kick me and then I kick you back, right? Whether retaliation makes sense depends on yourself because this retaliation is like you are just playing the opponent's role with the other party. If the other party attacks you, then you attack back, and you let the other party see some results that his actions will produce. As we said before in the psychic session, all things are not absolutely good or bad. If you look at it from a positive perspective, then you make the other person clearly see some of the results that his certain behaviors will produce, then he may not use this way in the future. So this can become a positive aspect. That is, if you think it's meaningful, it's meaningful. If you think it's not meaningful, it's not meaningful, because it can lead you into a vicious cycle, that is, it will deepen the causal relationship between you two, as you said.
This completely depends on whether you really need more experiences to make you understand. That is, if you need to use the experience of retaliation to make yourself understand that retaliation is useless, you can. That is, you want to enter this vortex and experience the energy inside. Then OK, I understand, understand and feel this energy. Then this is meaningful for you if you think you don't need to go. That is, if you can understand, then you don't need to go into this to experience it because you already understand how this system operates. Do you understand what I mean? That is to say, it's like when you people come to the material world. Then you might need to come to this material world to experience. If you understand everything about the material world like hatred, cause and effect, consciousness, vibration, frequency, and when you understand all of them, you don't need to enter anymore, right? You can continue to explore in other forms.
Although your consciousness is constantly exploring, constantly exploring, not all of them need to enter the material world in this way. Then do you in the material world need to use retaliatory means or methods to make you understand? It depends on yourself. But all experiences, as long as they can make you understand certain things, they are meaningful. If you think these are consuming your energy to understand and have no meaning for you, then you don't join. In this way, you won't consume too much time and energy in this aspect, and you can explore higher. But you humans enjoy playing these games very much. You have very powerful energy, but this energy is not used in the real, that is, the positive manifestation. So a lot of negative energy, many people have powerful energy, but it is manifested in a negative way. Any questions?

**Question:**Is there still a problem? This psychic girl still wants to say, can some guidance be given to those who choose to commit suicide? **Higher Spirit:** For those who ended their lives in the material world, give them some guidance. Before you came to this material world, you had to choose for yourself to forget everything, to forget that you are truly just energy. That is, you need to put on what seems like a set of clothes. Once you put on this set of clothes, you become this clothes. You forget that you just wore the clothes. It's like when you were knocked unconscious and completely lost your memory. Then, after putting on this clothes, you need time to adapt to it because adaptation requires a process. During the process of adaptation, many people feel uncomfortable. They want to take off because this clothes is too heavy. They want to take off this clothes and return to the state of their residence. So what words do you want to tell those who choose to quickly get rid of this uncomfortable dress? I want to tell them that you came here originally because you were going to fall in love with this dress.
So at the stage when you haven't fully adapted to it, hold on because just like you humans, it takes some time to cultivate a habit or a certain hobby. So you just get through that period of discomfort, and you will find that you will fall in love with this dress because your main purpose is to fall in love with this dress, not to get rid of it. Because when you get rid of this one, you will put on another one again and need to adapt again. If you can't pass each adaptation stage, you will repeatedly experience this topic 
So the only thing is that you need a firm belief and believe that you will fall in love with this dress. You will. You will fall in love with this dress.


**Question:**Why am I very disgusted with some people and things that randomly use the banner of spiritualism in the market?
**Higher Spirit:**Your such disgust comes from your sense of responsibility, from your sense of responsibility because you think their information will mislead, and some people are easily misled by others, especially after being covered by the so-called mysterious veil of superstition, or magic, or strangeness. They will take all the information seriously and be misled. So for you, you think that a person needs to reach a very high level before he can spread these sacred information. So this is a kind of sense of responsibility and sense of duty you have for people, for others, for society, or for humanity.

But you humans have been constantly misled. No matter what approach is chosen, even if he doesn't choose the psychic way, he may mislead as a teacher, he may mislead as a doctor, he may mislead as a parent, he may mislead as an official, that is, a government personnel. Do you understand?
That is to say, he may not be through psychic information. He may constantly mislead through other identities. So are you going to be disgusted with all the people in the world? Because everyone is misleading.

**Question:**Then what should I do?
**Higher Spirit:** You need to understand that this is your sense of responsibility, your sense of responsibility towards humanity. Because you humans don't have good role models, examples, and cases to set up.
Then you be this role model. Do you understand what I mean? Don't expect others. You be this role model. What kind of image that makes you have a favorable impression do you think it should be? Then you become that. Any questions?

**Question:**I want to ask what kind of relationship is there between having no limitations and having no illusions?
**Higher Spirit:** Relationship? Do you mean the relationship between people?

**Question:**No. For example, a person without limitations may still have illusions. Then does a person without illusions mean that he is without limitations?
**Higher Spirit:** Illusions. There are no illusions. Everything you experience is just an illusion. Whether you create a good or bad, positive or negative one for it, these are all illusions that you project out yourself. It's an experience you create yourself. It's as if you create a scene for yourself and immerse yourself in it. Do you understand what I mean? There are just some that are arranged to be terrifying, like a negative experience in hell. And there are some that are arranged to be as sweet as heaven. But all these experiences are just illusions. It's not that if it's positive and wonderful, it's true, and if it's negative or vice versa. Do you understand what I mean? None of them are true or false. They are all illusions. It's just that you decide for yourself what you want to experience.

Like what you all say about attaining enlightenment or something like that, that is to say, you understand that you are creating a scene for yourself to play with, and then you understand what kind of scene you want to experience. Do you understand? This is what you call an enlightened one or someone with a high level of consciousness. He knows what he is doing and what he wants to experience. But there are some people who don't know that this is a scene they set up themselves and are playing with. They think this scene is dead, fixed, given by God, or predestined. Do you understand what I mean? It can become real, that is, unchangeable. Because the scene can be changed at any time. If I don't like this scene, I can change it immediately for another scene to experience.

**Question:**Then I want to ask, for example, at my current level of consciousness, I know what this material world is like. Then the enlightened person you just mentioned also knows because spiritual practice is about cultivating the mind. Since we both know, then exactly what is the difference between me and an enlightened person? 
**Higher Spirit:** Why can't you create the scenarios you want to experience?


**Question:**I know that my scenarios are created by myself, and those who have attained enlightenment also know that the scenarios are created by themselves. So, where exactly is the difference between us?
**Higher Spirit:** That means you haven't attained enlightenment yet.

**Question:**Then where exactly is the difference between me and him? Isn't it said that cultivating the Tao is cultivating the mind?
**Higher Spirit:** Where is the difference between you? That is to say, you still need to experience it, right? There are still things you haven't comprehended and learned. There is still your gift here. Because it's not good for you to reach that state all at once. Do you understand? There is no end state here. Even if you have left this physical body, you will continue to create these for your experience. There is never an end state, a complete state.
It's possible that one of you is in the material world in life, and then another one guides and leads you in a higher dimension. So in her dream last night, she transformed herself into an avatar. One was studying, and one was teaching because what she needed to learn wasn't really learning. She just needed to restore her memory because all of these were already hers. She just needed to remember. It's like there's a pile of firewood. You look at it as if it's burned out, but if you put something in it, it flares up again immediately. That is to say, on the surface the fire is out, but in fact it isn't. As long as a little thing is put in, its fire source will rise again immediately. So her inspiration keeps flowing. On the surface, it seems that she is getting inspiration, rather than just awakening these memories. Because all this wisdom and information can be linked, shared and perceived by you. But for you physical beings, it's as if all the information that your soul has been storing. But even a soul that doesn't have such abundance and so many experiences, it can extract information anytime and anywhere for its learning, use and display. Let's go back to your question just now. What message did her dream last night want to convey to her? These messages are just like planting a seed for her, and then what it will grow into, or what it will become, or what it will present, or in what way it will present, she has her own free will and choice. But she has already been utilizing the dreams within the dreams and the information. That is to say, the information in her dreams mainly tells you that even if your eyes can see very clearly and what your hands touch are all real and solid things, things that seem so indestructible and unchangeable, they will all change as you transform with your willpower, your thoughts, your energy. Because in your material life, everything you experience seems too real to you. It's like if you are an overly exposed person who is angry. He hates me. How real it is. He really hates me to the point of gnashing his teeth. But you don't know that you can evoke such strong emotions from him. Very hard. Behind the hate, in fact, it is his need for you. Do you understand? But often, you humans tend to misunderstand it as just hate. So you only see some very external things, and then affirm and determine it, and then fix and solidify it. However, all of this is due to your disbelief. For example, if a person shows extreme hatred towards you, but you don't believe that he hates you. You believe that he loves you, and then you love him. You have no judgment on his actions (didn't understand), you just love him and allow him to vent his anger in his heart, and allow this energy to flow through him because you should know that what he shows is just that energy. Energy will pass because no one is fixed. His consciousness, his changes, everything about him is changing. His changes will change along with your changes. 
If you're sure that he hates me and then you hate him too, the relationship of hate between you two will deepen further. This relationship has been deepening. Do you understand? If you allow him to show his energy, but I won't be affected by his energy state. Why? Because I love him. I love every being. Because he has come into my life unexpectedly. Unexpectedly, I have a connection and entanglement with him. That is, we two are actually acquainted and have entered each other's lives. Then he must be my soulmate. That is to say, he must have a gift for me. Anyway, I respect him and I care for him. So when you are firm in this belief, this idea of yours, have you changed the other party? So you always have the power and the ability to transform everything in the material world, unless you believe it and then you deepen it.
It seems that something is just a phantom at the beginning. Right? It is very soft and mutable. But your belief, your resistance, or your rejection, or your attack or anything of yours, in fact, you are all injecting energy into it, making it stronger or more stable, reinforcing it. But when you believe in what you believe and create what you want to create, with the transformation of your mind, it will gradually disappear and then become invisible to you.

Why? Because you haven't chosen to maintain the same frequency with it. So in the dream, it is to let her see that everything outside is so real in your eyes. You can touch it, see it, smell it, feel it, and experience it. But it is all affected by your energy state. It will change as your energy state changes. What on earth do you believe? How much you believe, how real it becomes. So even if she was in a dream with a pool, a lake surface, crystal clear at the beginning. But she was teaching herself, using her own mind to make it turbid. The water in that pool became turbid under her concentration. Then she made it clear again. That is to say, when you focus, on what you focus, what you believe, what you will create. You don't look at whether the pool water is really turbid or falsely turbid, because you believe it will become clear. Because you know that even if it is turbid, it is because of the coming of the storm, making it temporarily lose its clarity. But with the transformation of this energy, it will eventually become clear. You can take action, understand? For example, in real life, if you believe that the pool, in your mind, is inherently clear and transparent, then you can take action, clean the garbage in the pool, protect it and cherish it because you believe it should be clear originally. You incorporate your actions and keep believing in it, and you will influence more people. They see your respect and love for the water in the pool, and they will join your ranks. They will help you together to make the water clear. Then you use your mental power to make the water clear. 
Although this is just using the pool as a metaphor, this phenomenon, or this theory, or this effect, it can occur in anything. It can happen anywhere. This is your energy, your intention, which can affect external substances, influence others, and create the world you want to create. Believe what you want to believe about this dream. She now has a deeper level. Do you have any other questions?

**Question:**Can you help me see what my dream last night was trying to tell me? Do I need to tell you what the content is?
**Higher Spirit:** You can, because the more clues you provide and the more information you say, in this way, our connection will be more stable. That is to say, I don't have to consume or search for information so hard.

**Question:**I dreamed that my mother told me that someone we both knew died. She was very sad and then I comforted her and told her that consciousness and personality would not die. Then it seemed that there was another person chasing us.  So, it can be in all kinds of ways. Even if, okay, you don't use any way. You just say that you want to look at the person opposite you from the perspective of the Creator. He will be influenced by you unconsciously. He will feel your unconditional love and tolerance. He doesn't know why. Do you understand what I mean? You don't need any language. You don't need to say anything. Just your eyes. Then you are also psychic. So let you become love, connect with love, integrate into love. Then everything your physical body touches, it will emit love. This is psychic. And about the information in your dream, the information you are conveying. That is to say, this is what you want to tell people. It is what you want to share. You know. 
That is to say, regarding the truth of life, all that you know, you want to tell others in your way to help those who still don't know the truth and let them see the truth as if others have no eyes and are all blind. You have a pair of eyes and you want to describe the beauty you see to them. Because only when your material eyes, that is, the eyes of the material world are closed, can you open your spiritual eyes and your soul eyes. If you keep your material eyes open all the time, you will be immersed in or too trusting of some things in front of you and you are led into this. That's why there are many blind people whose psychic abilities are particularly strong. They have a pair of eyes. Even if they may not be able to see your face, they know your energy state, all your information, everything about you.
This is why there are many blind people who choose jobs like fortune-telling. Understand? Maybe you have a pair of physical eyes, you have a pair of eyes, but you can't see through this person. Understand? You have no idea at all what kind of person he really is. Why? Because he himself doesn't know what kind of person he is, so he always shows different sides. He himself doesn't know who he is. What he shows for you to see, you also don't know what kind of person he really is. But the blind can clearly know what kind of person he is because they close their physical eyes. Any questions?

**Question:**Can you help us connect with Krishnamurti, and then this psychic girl wants to know what he has to say to humanity, thank you. 
**Higher Spirit:** First of all, I want to thank her because I can feel her every kind of approval and recognition of my language, my words, my thoughts, and my opinions. It can be said that none of my words has raised doubts, objections or negations in her mind. This is why she has a special sense of connection and identification with my energy state. Because she is not a person who believes everything if there is authoritative information. So I am very gratified by some of her identifications and approvals of my information in a person with her energy state and level of consciousness. That is to say, it's like finally someone can receive the gifts I give out because I keep giving gifts to humanity, but they are also constantly misused. It's like what I give out, what is digested and utilized is very, very little. So my entire life has consumed a great deal of my time and energy. I keep sending gifts out. That is to say, my efforts and the changes I bring are not proportional. That is to say, what I create, the energy I send out, the gifts I send out are far, far more than what they receive. Then what information do you want to know next?

**Question:** May I ask if you have anything to say to humanity?
**K:** What I want to tell you is that I have never disappeared. I just changed a way to assist you. My love for you has never disappeared either. I have never had any, as I just said, I sent out but received very little. I have no complaints or any regrets, or any disappointment. Because we have always been one and have never been divided. It's just that my energy is in different ways. It could be just a sentence. Just like this girl, she might suddenly think: Oh, I finally understand what Krishnamurti's sentence means. At that time, I exist in her life, understand? So I exist in this way in any of you who perceive me, or link to me, or see my energy. Even those who don't see me, they are also indirectly influenced by me. Why? For example, if this girl has a deep understanding of some of my thoughts, then she will manifest it in her life in her way. 
She will convey to others in her way. She will interpret to others in her way. She may have turned into her words, but the truly deep-seated thing remains unchanged. Do you understand?


## 2021/05/13 - Your imagination is your reality (no question)
**Higher Spirit:**Yes. We can't tell you which one and which one you should choose, but we can assist you to let you discover by yourself exactly how you want to present yourself. What's your name, XXX? Let me link first. Then you ask your question directly. Do you mean you choose this? Can you or what? What exactly is your question?
**Higher Spirit:**Why do you think you can't accumulate wealth? Because when you have this idea, you are already blocking it. Do you understand?
That is to say, whether I can accumulate wealth means that I have nothing. So, you said, 
**Higher Spirit:** This is what affects you. No matter what job I look for outside or which industry I choose, if you have this belief, that is, you have this thinking mode, you have this 'I think it's so difficult to earn wealth', doing this doesn't make money. If you just look at which one makes money, you won't be able to make money. Do you understand? So what limits you now is not what you do, but your own definition of yourself. It's like you have a system installed in your mind, and you have been operating according to that system. Do you think you can produce something beyond the scope of the operation of that system?
**Higher Spirit:** But your goal is still money. It's not unreasonable, but you have already shown that you are lacking internally. Because you need to know a truth that in your life, in every present moment of yours, at any time, you have always been abundant. You have never been lacking. Maybe on the surface it appears as a form of lack in your life, but it is precisely because of that lack that it pushes you onto your own life path. If there were no that lack, it might not have pushed you there. So this kind of lack that appears on the surface is actually a kind of abundance. In fact, it is unique to you, the most precious, and the most needed.
**Higher Spirit:**That is because of the temporary lack in your thoughts. If your thought pattern remains like this all the time, then you will always manifest like this. So whether it is temporary or not is decided by yourself.
**Higher Spirit:**The advice given to you is to let you examine your own system, examine your thought pattern, and examine your concepts.  The only thing you need to do is to exert and utilize your imagination, creativity, passion, and enthusiasm without any restrictions. All the definitions and concepts in your mind, these are all restricting you. Take the simplest example I give you. I give you a seed. You have a seed.
OK. That one loquat tree bears so many fruits. You can do it in various ways. You can sell it. You can also exchange it with others. You can do other things. You can also share it as love. Because when you share your love, it will come back to you. OK. You share your loquats. Then the neighbor has peaches in their home. He gives you some peaches. Then aren't you already rich? What if this one loquat tree, one seed grows thousands of them. Then you plant a thousand trees out of thousands. Just think about it. Your wealth multiplies and expands in such a way. This is just an example. But through this example, you can think about how limited the human mind is. So it's not that there is no wealth or insufficiency. It's because you don't know your limitations, the limitations in your minds that you can't see. Your consciousness determines what you can see.
There are many such examples for you humans. I retrieved from her mind.
One example is that there was a person, before, after he was released from prison in his eighties, he grew oranges and made a lot of money. Such a simple example. Then you say his resources, his age, his energy, his vitality compared to you... Why can he do it? So why do you limit yourselves? Your youth, your life, your vitality, these are your wealth. The wealth you possess the most, your imagination, these are all huge wealth. You just need to transform it, reveal it.
**Higher Spirit:**I have specifically, every detail told you. Your current limitation is not in what you choose.
**Higher Spirit:**It's your limitation, the limitation in your thoughts. Your limitations and deficiencies in thoughts and these concepts will manifest themselves in your physical world. But precisely because of this deficiency, for example, after you have this deficiency within, you think why I can't create wealth all the time, or I want (wealth) 
OK. If you link with me in this way, is it now opening up a financial path for you? If not, you might have earned a little money. Without this scarcity, you might still be experiencing a state of doing small businesses throughout your life, seeking food and clothing and earning a little money. Do you understand? So even your current experience is abundant and it's what you need most. So every step of yours is perfect, abundant and prosperous. Are there any other questions?
**Higher Spirit:**If you ask, you just ask about names, but we are all one. I, you and all are one. How do I distinguish myself? It's like when you ask about a wave in the sea. When you ask what the name of that wave is, it's just seawater. Every wave is seawater.
So how do you want me to answer you and how will you humans name it
**Higher Spirit:**It's also your naming. Everything in the material world is your naming because it's for you to identify.
**Higher Spirit:**Do you want to do business? Because merchants and educators are different. Do you just want to operate this system or do you want to be a trainer yourself? This is different.
**Higher Spirit:**If you want to be a merchant, that is, to create a system, then you need to look for such people, that is, they have a passion for this and you provide this platform, which is what you both want. You provide this platform as if you want to engage in show performances. Then you give them the stage, build (the stage) for them, give them everything, arrange it well, and find the audience for them, and let them perform. 因为他们喜欢唱戏,明⽩吗 那如果你⾃⼰是喜欢唱戏的⼈,那又不⼀样了所以你⾸先你要明确的知道你⾃⼰想要扮演什么⾓⾊,什么⾝份
⾼灵: 对,你⾃⼰想要做什么你都不知道,你如何把它拉到你的⽣命当中来
⾼灵: 那任何体验你都可以去体验,你没有任何局限和限制只要在你们的物质世界,你们物质世界有你们物质世界的规则和玩法就是说你们有你们的法律、法规,就是说有限制那你只要在你们的限制之内去活动,去运动,去运⽤你的想象⼒就好
Without harming anyone, including yourself.
**Higher Spirit:**Each of you feels that your talent is something that actually you have no limitations. Why? The so-called talent is as if you were born with it, you were born to do this. But once you enter a completely present state, a present connection, let go of your material mind, let go of your physical body, that is, all the notions and everything in your mind. No matter what you do, you can. Why? Because when you want to choose to experience that, you can invite that energy into you and then you become it. Imagine, your physical body, it's like, how can I describe it? Your physical body is just a tool. What really shows is your soul or something. 
You give it different souls, and it shows different appearances. You are so diverse and so unrestricted. It's only yourselves who are restricted.
Also, those who are restricted mean that they only want to experience this in their lifetime because they like singing and they only want to experience the life of singing. But if you ask them to act, or be a host, or do anything else, as long as it's him, you say.
**Higher Spirit:** The link is like one of your TVs. You can choose different channels to enter, but it's the same TV that's playing. Then you think of that TV, but you can play (anything). You can play horror films, you can play comedy films, you can play entertainment films, all kinds of appearances, but it's all you playing.

So your this tool, your this physical body wants to show to the material world is also the same. What do you want to show?
**Higher Spirit:**First of all, you have to understand that if when you are completely not influenced by the material world, you are just an existence of energy. Then this energy has no any limitations. This energy is just like when you enter the network, the network can search for anything. If you want to search for a puppy, puppies all come out. If you want to search for cooking, then the cooking ones all come out. Do you understand? Then when you yourself have no the restraint of your this physical body, you can link to whatever you want, just like a network. Because you yourselves... Why is it said that we are all one?
Because from the energetic level, we all come from there. It's like we are all on the land, on the turf. You are a flower, I am grass, he is a tree, he is something or other. But we all come from the land. Do you understand what I mean? It's just that we are presented in our own unique life forms.

But we all come from, emerging from the soil. You would say Mother Earth. That is to say, you all come from (the Earth). I'm just making an analogy because even that land all comes from the same (source). So there is no difference between you and the soil and the trees. It's just a manifestation of energy. It's just that your experiences are more abundant.

**Higher Spirit:**Spiritual practice is just a definition given by you humans, do you understand? If you really want to practice, that is to say, remove your concepts, thoughts, memories, and so on. It's you, OK. You are now in a sewage tank. You have to clean off the things attached to you. That is what you call practice, not adding things.
**Higher Spirit:** What limits you is the mind. OK. Let me give a simple example. This psychic girl didn't know anything she wanted to say, was going to say, or the things she was going to encounter before she psychic-communicated with you and linked with you. She didn't learn it, but at this moment, you can ask any questions and extract any information. Why? Because she has put her personal consciousness aside. Do you understand? That is what you call spiritual practice, but you can't do it.
**Higher Spirit:** You experience your life according to your passion. You know everything that happens to you. For example, OK, next you may have arguments with your relatives and loved ones again, or be angry or something. All of these are points for you to learn. Every place in life is where you break through yourself because the only thing that binds you is yourself. But through external events, you can gradually remove your own bindings. So you are constantly expanding and constantly removing the things that hinder you. That's good. There isn't one, as you say, using this method or that method, do you understand?
**Higher Spirit:**The only way is to let go of the methods in your mind and fully experience life. During the process of experiencing life, you will naturally have many mental activities, feelings, and obstacles, which are called something in your material world. But all these things are like your points. It's as if you are walking. During your walk, you constantly encounter branches that hinder you. Only when you walk past can you pick up and remove those branches and clear a path for yourself. Understand? If you don't walk past, your path will never be cleared. That is to say, if you don't engage in your current life, you can't carve out a path for yourself. Then you remain in place. The same goes for your thinking patterns and your restraints. They also remain in place.
**Higher Spirit:**You don't have to do any exercises. The exercises you do pull you onto one. But if that's your passion and you like to do it, then do whatever you like to do. But if you are for achieving a certain purpose, you don't need to because your purpose is not in the distance but only in the present, right now, in life. Everything that comes into your life is not waiting for you tomorrow, in the future, or in a certain place. No.
**Higher Spirit:**That is what you yourselves create. You can create. The most interesting thing about you humans is that you can create anything you can imagine to play with you. Understand? If some people like to create these and they define it like this, then they define it like this and they experience it. It has nothing to do with you. Why? If you believe them, it has something to do with you and you can experience it. If you believe them, it has nothing to do with you. So you have to know how this operating mode operates. So don't look at anyone saying that these people all say so, are all like this, and they all have this experience and then it's true. That is indeed true. Because no matter you all, even those mentally ill people, what they experience is also real. But why don't you believe them? Why do you lock them in the hospital?
Because only he is experiencing that reality. You don't identify with it, and you treat him differently. When you identify with it, you think it's true.
**Higher Spirit:**Reincarnation, what you call reincarnation. You think you just think that you, this soul, again and again and again and again, goes to have different experiences in life. There is no time or space here. The so-called reincarnation means that this energy of yours, you can choose different experiences. In your China, in this province, I experienced this. In the United States, in that place, I experienced as a woman. In China, I experienced as a man. Then I also experienced as an animal in Africa. Do you understand? That is, your energy can choose simultaneously. Just like before, there was a metaphor when we were communicating with spirits. That is, one of your hands, five fingers, each finger is placed in a different space. One is placed in ice to experience the cold, one is placed in warm water to experience the warm water, and one is placed in chili peppers to experience the spiciness. Do you understand? But all these can collect this information.
**Higher Spirit:**Of course, the entire universe is in your minds. You know the universe, then I tell you it is the entire universe, everywhere.
�� **Higher Spirit:**Yes Because his consciousness is constantly experiencing, constantly changing, constantly experiencing, and never stopping. It just changes the way.
**Higher Spirit:**If you only identify with your physical body, you are insignificant. If you do not identify with your body, then you are unlimited and everywhere is you.
**Higher Spirit:**Because you are using your memory, your memories, in your minds, your material minds, your heads, that memory. You can completely not believe it because it is chaotic in itself. There is a bunch of garbage stored in it in itself. It is all illusions, all fake, and all the experiences created because of your concepts. So those are not, not nutritious, not nourishing and all of you are trapped there, that bunch of garbage in your minds. So you still regard memory as something like a treasure, thinking that the things in your memory are real. But the things in your memory are all dead. All dead. Only the present moment is alive. Each of you is drinking a bunch of stagnant water, moldy and raw sewage. That kind of sewage. You still treat it as a treasure and drink it. Why do you have so many toxins in both your thoughts and your body?
You have been drinking this sewage. There is fresh water but you don't drink it. What is it?

**Higher Spirit:**Yes, you are now searching for the widest range of information. You are doing this right now.
**Higher Spirit:**You are a little enlightened.
**Higher Spirit:**Not limited to any way. Anything you are passionate about. Even if you like dancing, you just dance. Because when you truly follow the music and dance along with it, your self no longer restricts you. Because only when you enter the present moment can you connect to the energy of that music and let that energy dance in your body. So it is not limited to anything.

**Higher Spirit:**Fully engage in your life, but know which are truths, which are illusions, which are hallucinations you create. Understand what you are playing with. Half of your body is fully experiencing in the material world, and half of you are soberly aware of what you are doing. Which is true, which is false, which is a created illusion, which is someone else's illusion, and which is the collective consciousness. Because if you let yourselves be completely that way, you will be separated from matter, and you will not learn the things you need to learn in this material world. Because each of you is here to constantly breakthrough, learn and expand. Understand? So you have to rely on this physical body, connect to this physical body, and at the same time, partly detach from this physical body to achieve a balance. Everything is balanced. If you can't balance, then you will become like a lunatic as others say, a mental patient.
If you are overly and don't have that connection or something, then you are just drifting along in the material world. That is, you will only experience the pain brought by the overly physical aspect of the physical body. So it's okay to balance this energy.
**Higher Spirit:**You said you don't know you are dreaming when you are dreaming, right? You are now in the material world like a dream, and you don't know you are dreaming either. 你还把它当成真的你还把⼀切的困难、阻碍、困扰,当成如此坚不可摧如此我是弱的,梦才是真的你现在就是在物质世界这个梦⾥⾯
⾼灵:如果你知道梦⾥⾯的⼀切都是假的,你不会受到任何伤害,只是体验⽽已现在这些体验会让你⼼惊胆跳,会让你哭泣、伤⼼但是真正的你就像呢个⾁体,你说在梦⾥⾯什么伤害会伤害到你的⾁体不会的那你在这个物质世界的梦也⼀样的,没有什么能伤害到真正的你,你只是在做梦⽽已虽然所有的感受都是真的
⾼灵: 因为你刚才⾃⼰都说了,我在做梦的时候我不知道⾃⼰在��梦



You still take it as real. You still consider all the difficulties, obstacles, and troubles as being so impregnable and yourself as being so weak. The dream is real. You are now in this dream of the material world.
**Higher Spirit:** If you know that everything in the dream is false, you won't be hurt. It's just an experience. Now these experiences will make your heart race, make you cry and be sad. But the real you is like that physical body. You said that in the dream, no harm can hurt your physical body. It's the same for you in this dream of the material world. Nothing can hurt the real you. You are just dreaming. Although all the feelings are real.
**Higher Spirit:** Because you just said it yourself. When I was dreaming, I didn't know I was dreaming.
If you think you don't need it, then you don't need it. But for some, on the surface they think they need it, but internally they are resisting, that is, rebelling, that is, not wanting it. So this has caused many emotional conflicts. This is also some internal conflicts for him. But whether you want it or not, in any case, in fact, all relationships are just like mirrors. They present some of your internal constraints or something inside you, and only then can you start and deal with it.
It could be a parent-child relationship, a relationship with a supervisor, or a relationship between men and women. Different relationships are just presented (interrupted) **Higher Spirit:** I am attracting you now too. 
**Higher Spirit:** I understand what you mean.  Also because you don't have it within yourself, you need external assistance or that is your self-permission, a fantasy you create for yourself. You think that because you people all need to create one of those things for yourself to make it seem real, to become real and then your real experience deepens your own belief.
**Higher Spirit:**You just need to find out what belief, what it is, what you believe that makes you think you are not powerful, understand? Because if you keep telling yourself that you are powerful, to be honest, that means you are denying yourself, you are disguising. You just need to find out exactly what you believe that makes you think you are not powerful enough, that you are weak. What exactly do you believe? Then remove this thing you believe in, because that doesn't belong to you, and that's fine.
**Higher Spirit:**You don't know what you believe in yourself. Then in your life, these actors who act with you will cause relationships, cause events, and everything will be presented to you. You just need to pay attention to your life, enter your life, and fully enter your life. Just like I just said, you just sit here and don't move at all. Let the teacher, take this branch away for me. Where is this branch? You have to go yourself and walk until you encounter the branch and then remove it. Your path will come out. This is what you have to do yourself, instead of standing in the same place. But standing in the same place, I'm just telling you that you need to walk a path yourself and there will be branches on the way. Each branch hindering you, you just need to remove it, okay, do you understand? 
**Higher Spirit:** It doesn't matter. Keep going. Are there any more questions?
**Higher Spirit:** Because you are all afraid of change and the unknown internally, and you all think you are lacking. Let me tell you that even if you have nothing in that house, you have to trust that life makes you have nothing in order to inspire you and give you something. Do you understand? You shouldn't take a certain point in the material world as your safety umbrella or shelter. That is, I am rich when I have this. You don't need anything external to support you. You feel rich internally because everything external is manifested from your internal. If internally, no matter what is taken away, it is actually clearing the way for you and allowing you to inspire your greater energy to manifest your richness, then why would you care about this? So it's your concept, your father's concept that's hindering him because they think they are powerless, as if he believed that he's old, can't make money, and has no ability, and then he experienced this reality.
Just this one house. He believed all these.
**Higher Spirit:** You don't have to help him at all. You just need to see yourself through him because you also have your obstacles. See yourself. In fact, if you tell your father that all these of yours are illusions and you have no obstacles, and then you can't do it in your life. If you can present yourself, even if I have no money at all, I can have the whole world. If you can embody this, you have already helped him. Understand? Because through you, he will regard you as another house. He thinks that since I have this big house, this big palace, I am wealthy.
**Higher Spirit:**First of all, you should know that the purpose of your relationship is also the relationship. In your relationship, it is that you love him, no matter what he chooses. OK, this is the first point. That is, you won't stop loving him just because he chose to do this. Is that love? That's not love. Right? But if you don't love him and don't care about him, why would you have a sense of loss? It's because in your mind, regarding friendship or friends or thinking that he should... You first have a "should", have a definition. Just as I said earlier, because of the definitions in your minds. Well, what if you could let go of all the definitions in your mind? Just observe what he is really like. Then in fact, your friendships are built based on what kind of person you think he is, not with the real him.
**Higher Spirit:**If we told you that we have expectations of you, how would you feel? Would you think that you are being controlled? We have no expectations of you. Even if you grow and experience in the most, most, most negative way, we will not have any judgment of you, or condemnation, or say that you have hurt something, humans or whatever. There are no sinners, villains, or criminals here. You are just growing and experiencing by this way. You choose this way. At most, we tell you that you don't need to choose such an extreme way to learn the lessons. 
But the right to choose is still in your own hands.
**Higher Spirit:** Because with this kind of thinking mode of yours, you will apply it to your lover. You will think, "Why doesn't my boyfriend treat me like this? He should be like this. Other boyfriends are like this." When you have such a concept, you will definitely kill your relationship and bring many obstacles to your relationship. So let go of the "should" in your mind and let him show his true self instead of the way you think he should be. Only in this way are you having a relationship with a real person instead of a fake one that you imagined in your mind. You say, **Higher Spirit:** Only you yourselves can make you feel hurt. The definitions in your mind, not others. Others are just being their true selves.

They have their choices. In the relationships they want to experience, you should allow the other party to experience, perceive, and comprehend in their own way. You say.

## 2021/05/18 - What is the best experience in the material world?

**Question:**The Ziwei Saint in the prophecy comes from the East. Can you talk about this information?
**Higher Spirit:**Wait a moment. I'll link. First, I need to link and see if there are some information skills about this information. First of all, I want to thank you for making this psychic connection happen. Because of the current psychic environment and her psychic state, and your energy field is a very, very high and very harmonious state. So today we can bring you a lot of information that is very helpful to you. Just like in your material world, that is to say, your current energy state like this is very suitable, that is, you are always very happy. Why?
Because both of you are very studious children and your energy is very pure and you are completely opening yourselves, that is, in such an energy state without the slightest doubt or resistance. So thank you very much for participating in this spiritual communication this time. Because this information not only helps you at this moment, but will also help or bring help to many people in the future. Because all of these are like light, which can illuminate those in the darkness. When those people have the same doubts or problems, or need guidance in this regard, they will be guided to this information and receive this information. They can then see the light and feel the light. I'll repeat your question. Do you want to know what the Ziwei Saint in the prophecy is, right? On your network, among your historical prophecies, there emerged many about that in your current era, there will be a person called the Ziwei Saint who comes from the East. Then you want to know information about this aspect. Regarding the Ziwei Saint, he is not a certain person. He is a kind of energy. Just like the sun rising from the East, it is the entire light that illuminates the East. Can you say he is a person? He is a kind of energy. This kind of energy can be manifested through many people.
So, it is more like the light of a group of people. The light of a group of people, they gather together, as if huddling for warmth. It is this kind of energy gathering together, generating the light, generating the influence, generating the heat, generating anything. So, more precisely, he is more like a group, that is, a bunch, a large part, a set, like this. But why do they mention a certain person? Because a person is like a bellwether. It's like that one person led a group of people to shine. In fact, that group of them are all saints, the holy light because their spiritual levels are the same. Then why do they mention a certain person? Because that one person came out. It seems that you all chose him as a representative of that group of energy. And that one person is a pioneer. He woke up first and then awakened others. Do you understand what I mean?
So this will be like a team, but there will be a leader. Then the leader, he woke up first, and then woke up the others. So they have no distinction of superiority or inferiority because their energy states are the same. Then this powerful energy, wherever it goes, it infects wherever it goes, just like your current epidemic, disease, the kind that spreads. That is, the disease spreads everywhere. And this energy in the future will too. So they say this ray of light and energy, the holy energy comes from the East. Now, the two of you, what you are doing currently is among the light. You are also a part of it. Then this part is them, just like themselves. Because if you want to create some real images or some collective consciousness in the material world, a group of people's consciousness and thoughts are needed. Then you are that group of people. Then it spreads like a disease and spreads such energy. This team will grow stronger and stronger. Do you have more you want to know about this?

**Question:**So this east, that is to say, the sun rises from the east, representing a beginning. Does it also refer to a specific position or just the rising from the east?
**Higher Spirit:**If from your perspective, indeed this energy comes from you. You in China. Because of the current state of Western countries, the first is that people with faith, their faith is too much, that is, their faith is a restraint for them. People without faith, their science is a restraint for them. So this energy state comes from here among you.

However, just like the sun, it rises from the east. It doesn't matter. Because in general, it doesn't matter where it rises to illuminate the entire Earth because every corner will be illuminated. Then you say that some people are actually closely linked together, so there is no such thing as specifically dividing it. Regarding this issue, are there any questions?

**Question:**No, thank you. Then the second question, what is true freedom for humanity?
**Higher Spirit:** If you say that you humans have freedom, you are very free. If you say that humans have no freedom, you are very unfree. So whether you want to look at it from the perspective of freedom or non-freedom, you can, just as you say that you have both day and night. So saying this is also part of freedom, just like the two sides of a coin, both freedom and non-freedom exist. But for you humans, experiencing unfreedom is also for experiencing freedom. Because if you only experience freedom, you won't know that this is the state of freedom. That is to say, when you come to this material world, you have to experience its opposite. Whether you experience it directly or indirectly. A direct experience is when you are the person involved. An indirect experience is when you experience it passively or it is the experience of your relatives around you, all kinds of experiences. But the opposite side, you must experience it.
Because if you don't experience it, you won't know what it is. In your material world. Your question again. For humans, true freedom is that after you have experienced unfreedom and being bound, you can find the way to freedom. Because when you find the way to freedom through yourself, this will no longer bind you. Because you have, it's like you have groped your way to that path and found that way out by yourself. If someone else were to remove the obstacles for you from the outside, you would still encounter obstacles because you don't understand from within that those are your obstacles. So true freedom is that you have it within, it's like you have a key in your hand and you unlock your handcuffs, and you know that the key is always in your hand. This is true freedom. If you want to handcuff yourself, you can. If you want to release yourself, you can. You are in control.

Do you have any questions about this issue?


**Question:**No. The third question is what is the best and highest experience that can be experienced in the material world? That is to say, you, OK. The material world is a cage. You are in the cage now. You have the key in your hand. You can freely enter and exit. You are in control of all this. And the best experience is this. Because of entering and exiting, you know that you can control it instead of being passive. When you feel that everything is passive for you and you have no ability to transform it, what you feel is pain, obstruction and restraint. When you know that everything is within your control and you can handle it with ease because you understand all the laws and all the rules and you can clearly understand the reasons behind them and use them freely. Because all these seem to be yours. That is, if you don't even understand what is restraint and what is pain in the material world, how can you help others get out of pain? It's like just now it was said that there was a fool. When he saw others getting injured or killed, he was laughing and thought it was fun. Do you think such a person can do wise things in your material world? So he must understand everything, but he won't be trapped in it because he has all the ways out, that is, he has the key and his key can also open others'. This is the best in your material world experience, that is, you control everything.

**Question:**When we leave the material world, what about our lovers?
**Higher Spirit:**Your lovers. By "your lovers", you mean the partners around you in the material world, the people you love. The people you love have never truly been separated or left in any sense. You just from your cognition and your perspective, that is your memory, your cognition because you will take it as true. You say in my mind I only remember this little thing, and then you think it's true. Just like a little child, in the first few months after birth, he doesn't remember the places he has been. Then when he grows up, you say when you were one month old you came here. He says I don't remember. For him, this didn't happen. And for you, you don't remember that you, that is, you who were once in love with those people have always been together, you will think that didn't happen. Just like those little babies, they don't remember the things they have experienced but their parents do remember.
That is to say, although your physical body, your flesh doesn't remember But for instance, you are now linked with me, and then I know that all are beings of higher dimensions, they know everything. So, your question is that when your physical bodies leave this material world, where is your lover? If it's a physical lover, you and him, both of you disappear. What disappears is only your physical bodies, but your consciousness, that is, your souls. Your souls can simultaneously choose because you can still continue to communicate. That kind of communication occurs just like the communication we have now. In your eyes, it's a manifestation of psychic ability. And then that kind of communication, you can still continue to choose what you want to experience next. For example, before you experienced a marital relationship, then next you might say that we want to experience another kind of relationship and love each other again. So you can continue the experience based on what you yourselves want to experience. But you will all choose simultaneously to enter each other's lives in different identities because you are essentially the same energy. That is to say, as understood by you humans, it's like reincarnation. Why? Because you yourselves come and go. How to describe this? It's like two feet tied together. Every progress is made together. So every experience is that you may use different bodies and different identities, but back to the source, that is, at the stage of consciousness, it is a common expansion. So the disappearance and separation of the physical body are just your illusions, just like you wore a prop to play house and then took off the prop, and then put on another prop to continue playing, and each of you had a great time.
This can answer you well. That is to say, after changing clothes, where did you go? Will you still choose what you all want to experience and explore together? Do you have any questions about this?

**Question:**Can I think of it this way, that is, from ancient times to the present, our souls, our minds are actually unchanged. What changes is that the physical body where we are hosted can be different, but our souls are the original thing.
**Higher Spirit:**Each of your physical bodies, each individual, will have a separate one. That is to say, even if this physical body of yours disappears, your personality still exists. Your personality, your characteristics, everything about you still exists. This is why you can have psychic communication. For example, with your deceased grandfather, you can still keep in touch with him. That is to say, their personalities still continue to exist. But your grandfather cannot be reborn. But your grandfather, that is to say, your grandfather cannot be reborn with his personality because his personality exists eternally. Just imagine, each of you is a different leaf. There is a leaf that has rotted. You can actually still see the shape of that leaf, right? So it's there. That rotten leaf is still there, but the life consciousness does not follow. Just like a tree root, it can still grow many leaves. So its life, you say: Ah, the leaves are rotten. Is that life dead? No. The tree still keeps growing leaves and keeps growing different leaves. This means that your consciousness is continuous, always continuous. If you have difficulty understanding, you can imagine that your physical body is a leaf. After this leaf of yours is gone, when spring comes, another leaf will grow. Although you see that it's a different leaf, it comes from the same life. Then this leaf contains all the information of this life. You can continue to ask any questions you want to ask, because the more questions you have, the more information we give and the more it can help you to understand with some of your existing cognition and concepts. Because some of our existing concepts and cognition are difficult to understand comprehensively. 
Even if you are often in spiritual communication, you are often having direct conversations with us. But truly, truly, truly, what you can see is only a very, very small bit. But even such a tiny bit is enough for you to change your life. This shows how much wisdom and how much energy the Creator has.
Even if you yourself just sneak a glance, that energy can allow you to transform your life.

**Question:**The next question is, can there be only happiness but no pain and troubles in life?
**Higher Spirit:**This is a little similar to the previous question. That is to say, if you can only laugh like a crazy person every day, do you think his life is meaningful? So troubles and pain are not for you to be trapped in them.
If you think being deeply involved in it can bring you the lessons you want to learn and the experiences you want to have, you can make such a choice. But annoyance and pain are like a change in the weather as you call it. Then there is a saying that the moon has its waxing and waning. Also, when you cook, different flavors need to be mixed together. This is also your life. Why? Because pain can make you feel the power of happiness and love more. Because love can melt everything and tolerate everything. Annoyance can help you understand. If a person has wisdom, after you have wisdom, you will find that all things are not annoyances. Annoyances are all your own cognition and opinions. After your own limited cognition, so if you have this experience, you can experience the other side, that is, the opposite side. Then people's consciousness improvement or awakening is accompanied by pain and annoyance. So you should not shut out pain and annoyance. Pain and annoyance are just like energy. You just need to know how to transform it and utilize it to help you grow better in the material world. Blindly pursuing anything is an unbalanced state. That is to say, the best state is that you do not pursue happiness and joy, nor do you avoid pain. Why? Because for you, everything is an illusion. You know that both pain and happiness are actually fabricated by your mind. Do you have any questions about this?

**Question:**"Yes." <Buddha, Guan Yin and Jesus, what are the differences and commonalities among them? 
**Higher Spirit:**Buddha and they all come from the high latitudes. That is to say, they are already in the high latitudes. Just like the high-latitude energy you are currently connected to, and then this energy wants to come to Earth. That is, they chose to come to Earth and project a part of themselves to Earth to bring gifts to you through the physical body. That is to say, we are giving you gifts now. Our gifts are through the intangible, that is, this mode of transmission. But we do not personally transform ourselves into physical bodies to give you gifts face to face. Because for them or for us, giving out our gifts face to face is a very great act for us.> It is a very difficult behavior because people in your material world are like, let's say, it's like you are a person in the material world now and you go to a primeval forest. The people in that primeval forest are particularly closed-minded and attack everything they see. Because they think everything is harmful and they all use violent means, use war or weapons, use violence to rule or oppress others. This most primitive kind. We tell you that such humans, because their cognition is too narrow, they will regard everything as attacking them. Even if you are their family member, relative or lover, they will regard you as the attacking side and attack in direct, indirect and various ways because they always regard any external person or thing as an enemy. This is a state of you humans at present. You regard basically all the external things as external, that is, opposite, that is, enemies. So for anyone who wants to approach you, you will have doubts about him. You will think whether he has bad intentions towards me. You think whether his kindness is that he wants to do something to me.

So on the surface, you seem harmonious and polite, but in fact, many of your relationships are opposite.

In such a low-cognition social environment, such a savage and primitive tribe, do you think you dare to send yourself there? Because maybe what you say, they don't understand. Because you have different languages. That is, no matter how right or good or correct what you say is, they simply don't understand. They are using the most primitive, for example, the simplest example. When you went to the primitive tribe, and then that person had a problem with his organ. You told him that I could instantly make your problem disappear and make your tumor vanish. But he wouldn't believe you. He would choose to believe their barbaric doctor to cut it off. Do you understand? They also have a kind of rejection towards their bodies. Do you understand? You should know that tumors are also a part of you. Your mind can make tumors arise, and your mind can also make tumors disappear. But those barbarians would cut off their bodies. Then he keeps growing tumors and keeps cutting them off.
He wants to kill the tumor, and he has to kill all the healthy parts of himself. Many of you, in order to kill something external, even if it grows inside your bodies, you would rather commit suicide. 
Because of some thoughts in your minds, or pain, or inability to accept certain things, you choose to end your lives because in your minds or in your cognition, there is only the most primitive method, which is to destroy everything, even yourselves, and you feel that it's worth it. If you were asked to enter a tribe where in their eyes there is only the idea of destroying everything, imagine for a moment, how much courage would you need to truly enter there and then truly awaken or change their concepts and thoughts, and let them know that they don't need to use the method of destruction. Do you understand what I mean? So they are all using this way to want you to evolve or learn or comprehend and see something more.
Just in this process of transformation and evolution, you don't need such cruel and tragic means to do these. Your tragic means, to yourself, to others, to children, to everything. However, you all think it's love, and you all think it seems like the best way. So when we look at you, then you are such a primitive one. But in your Earth, there are also many, many beings with such states of consciousness among you. They are also using their own ways to, how to say, just like what was said before about the plague virus infection, they want to infect, but these infections are positive, full of love infections.

**Question:**Then what about their differences?
**Higher Spirit:**Their differences, their differences lie in that they chose different paths when coming to the material world. 
**Question:**What does this road refer to?
**Higher Spirit:**It's about, for example, how to enter, how to become, how to influence and awaken. But it's not that they are truly helping you only when the physical body is present. Why? Actually, because that physical body is not the true physical body. It's just that you think, why not the true physical body? Because once you are in this world, that is, when you are born on this earth, you must have a material body. It's like you bought a prop, right? If you want to inject your energy into that prop, that prop must be alive and have life. Every life has its own consciousness of the physical body. At most, you can choose to achieve a connection or unity with its consciousness or be in such a state. 
**Question:**So I can understand that the methods are different, but the information they want to convey is basically similar.
**Higher Spirit:**They are all highly intelligent. They are all from high latitudes. They are all for love or help or awakening, for your transformation. It's all love. Because when you become one, that is, it's that simple. You humans will too. When you are an adult, you will involuntarily, autonomously, and actively help those little babies who fall while walking. You will help the little babies. So it's the same for you. You will help those who are weaker than you. In your eyes, when you see that they need help, you will actively help. Then their differences, their differences are like each and every one of you. In fact, each and every one of you is different, but each and every one of you is also the same. So this similarity and difference are the same. What else is the problem?


**Question:**May I ask what other information can be conveyed to the psychic in front of us?
**Higher Spirit:** The information I want to convey to her is that those who are paying attention to her transformation, growth and becoming, that is, those beings who have been helping you and her transform in other dimensions. What they want to say is, first of all, they feel very, very gratified, that is, happy and satisfied. The best word to describe it is gratified. Then she is on this path, and she doesn't need to have any doubts, nor does she need to have any fears or apprehensions, because for every step she takes, all the guidance she needs will appear in her life because she is not walking alone. She walks with many, many beings who want to use this energy to transform your material world. So all this information wants to tell her is to firmly believe in yourself, and then leave everything else to the so-called Creator. Because it's as if she is walking in the air now, but with each step she takes, a step will automatically appear in front. Then the only thing is to not be afraid of why there is nothing here but I have to put my foot down, understand? There is no need to have this kind of fear, or the unknown, or be afraid, or worried. She just needs to believe that when her foot goes down, there will be strength supporting her. It's this complete trust, for the future, for the unknown. Is there anything else?

**Question:**What is the fear of this psychic now?
**Higher Spirit:**She is now like a child who has just learned to walk. She was very excited. She felt like, "Wow, I don't have to crawl on the ground anymore. I can walk now." It was more of that kind of excitement and joy, and that feeling of "I finally have strength." Then her current fear. It can only be said that at her level of consciousness, she has no fear. But at the physical level, that is to say, some of your old patterns in the body, some old habits. That is to say, if you keep going, you will start running. It's a process of habit. Understand? It's like a child who just learned to walk and just knew that she had strength. She was excited, happy, and couldn't wait to keep walking. But she would still stumble a little, but then it would get smoother and better as she went on. So just need to trust and play heartily. 
Are there any more questions?

**Question:**No, thank you.


## 2021/05/27 - The only job you have when coming to this world is to enjoy life.

**Question:**The first question I want to ask is about love. I find that every time I meet someone I like, I feel a very restrained or nervous energy. It makes me do some things that limit myself. For example, what should I do and what should I not do in order to be loved? I want to know what this energy is. Do I believe in a restrictive belief to be like this?
**Higher Spirit:** Let me link first. Let me sense what your name is.

**Question:**My name is XXX.
**Higher Spirit:** XXX, do you want to know the feeling your body has when you are in contact with the boy you like? Do you think this is a restrictive belief?
First of all, why do you think that when your body has a reaction, this is a restrictive belief? For example, when your body has a reaction, like when you are hungry, it's also a reaction of your body.

**Question:**Because I found that when I was influenced by this energy, I would have many practices that restricted myself, and I would also think a lot. So I think there must be a belief restricting me.
**Higher Spirit:** Then it's not the feeling of the body but more that you are trapped in your thoughts. You are trapped in a web you wove yourself.

**Question:**Because I have always wanted to dig out this belief, that is, what I believe in and why I restrict myself like this.
**Higher Spirit:** You are afraid that you will completely lose control, understand? It's like this relationship will go in a direction that is unknown to you. You don't know. You are not sure to go in this direction.  and Leave it to fate, to God, to the Creator, to your Higher Self because this is not something you can understand. Because your mind will only search from your experiences, your memories. If you search there, you will create another same map for yourself to follow. Then you will still be trapped in some of your past pains or past experiences. You people are not clear about, do not understand the entire operation mode of you people. Imagine if your minds could really control everything, you would have defeated the COVID-19 pandemic long ago. Understand? So, everything is a kind of energy, and this energy is always changing. It will go down as if in your material world. Then it will also go uphill and be flat. You don't need to interfere with it in any way because it is constantly changing and flowing. However, even if you have this kind of feeling yourself, for example, if you feel blocked in your heart or something like that, you don't need to name it excessively and say what kind of limitation this is for me or what's wrong with me. You just need to let it know, OK, it's just a feeling, a reaction produced by my body. This reaction will come and it will also go. You shouldn't let this feeling cause you to have a sense of fear because if some feelings come and you have fear, it will become serious in the future. It doesn't matter.  and Some people see nothing and just pass by in a flash. Some others are immersed in their own minds and can't see anything in front of them. Understand? Then they just pass by life. This is the difference. If you are in this relationship and you still do this, no matter how long or short the time is with this person, it will bring you your gifts. If you are just acting various scenes in your mind, you will make it really happen in your life. Understand? Because you have been arranging that plot, then things may develop in the direction you are afraid of. Then you are actually distorting a relationship. Understand? It was originally a relationship that brought you gifts, but you turned it into a hurt for you. Originally, it was happiness, but you turned it into pain. You interfere with it, and it will affect the things that happen in your material world. For example, if you preconceive or fear something, then in your material world, it will push this material world matter in the direction you rehearsed in your mind. Why? Because it wants to prove itself right.
This is a game of your brain and also a game of your ego, that is, you want to push the matters of the material world in that direction, and then say: Look, I was right, wasn't I? This is a negative belief, a mode in which they operate.

**Question:**Actually, I now feel more and more trusting of the universe and life. But if when I have this negative feeling again, is it (interrupted by the Higher Spirit) **Higher Spirit:** You should not define this feeling as a negative one.  and It would be fine 
Instead of randomly hitting it and saying "get away" or "go away", because when you do that, aren't you also consuming yourself? You still need to muster a force to fight against it. In this way, you yourself will be powerless. You only need to tell it: Thank you for the things you want to tell me or remind me of. I have received it.

**Question:**Then I still want to ask one question. Is this boy who appeared here to help me break through in the process of my self-breakthrough?
**Higher Spirit:** All of them. Even if you are communicating with this girl now, she is also here to help you, to see yourself, like a mirror. All relationships have this purpose.

**Question:**Because this boy was focused on by me during my meditation some time ago. What I don't understand is whether he is just the frequency I connected to?  
**Higher Spirit:** We can't tell you because it will affect you from getting what you deserve in this relationship. Do you understand? It will change your trajectory. We can't interfere with your trajectory, and you also can't overly hand over your destiny or such matters to no matter where this voice comes from, even if it comes from God. Do you understand? You should know that you yourself are God, so don't come from the outside. You need to follow your own true (feelings). For example, if you particularly trust authoritative information, this person is truly like a god-like existence and this person tells you that you and he are, that is, he is the only lover in life and you and he are a perfect match. But in this relationship, he has been violent to you, he has been hitting you, being violent to you, treating you viciously. But because you believed that sentence, you remained in this violent relationship.
So can you understand what I mean? Don't listen to any outsiders telling you how to decide your fate because only you yourself know which path is the best, the most suitable, the most comfortable and the one you most want to experience. Because you are new, you are new and you create. So there is no prescribed dead-end road for you to follow. You use your life and your understanding of life to create a (path).

**Question:**Because for the first time I felt it. I don't know if this can be called manifestation because I think it was quite fast. Then I want to ask about my job because I asked about my job before and was told that I just need to relax and focus on the beautiful points in my life, which is enough. Then I'm relaxing now and not deliberately focusing. (Interrupted) 
**Higher Spirit:** The only, only, only, only, only job you have when coming to this world is to enjoy life itself. It's not that you must go to a certain place to clock in to be called work. Do you understand?

**Question:**I understand. But because in the material world, one needs to make money. 
**Higher Spirit:** Then you need to use your imagination. There are all kinds of ways to make money. If you just say you want to solve my material life problem, then you can solve it. It's not necessarily that you need the kind of step-by-step work form to solve it. Like your network, there are too many of these platforms.

**Question:**I want to ask that if seen from the perspective of people in the material world, I haven't done anything.
**Higher Spirit:** Yes, because you are still trapped in your minds. You impose a rule on people's lives, thinking that one should have a family, a partner, a job, and a serious matter. But this is not the case. Not every soul coming to this world wants to have such an experience, do you understand? If it's what other souls want to experience, they can have it that way. But not every soul needs such an experience. So you don't need to confine yourself within a framework, thinking that only by conforming to this is considered normal. This will cause you anxiety because you will feel that you haven't reached a normal state yet. This will make you split. This doesn't keep you in a unified state. Because when you truly reach a unified state, you will feel the completeness and fullness of life. When life is truly complete and you feel complete, everything external to you is there to support you. Understand? Just like when you need food, someone will bring it to your door. You are such a recipient. Even the smallest of your needs will be supported, but it may not be exactly what you have in mind. Understand?


**Question:**Then all I need to do is relax and have complete trust. Achieving these two points would be great, right?
**Higher Spirit:**Just as said earlier, enter into life, as if entering each present moment, the scenery you see. In this way, your inspiration will keep flowing. Only when you consider yourself as just a piece of flesh in motion, a physical body, that is, when you only regard yourself as a lump of flesh moving, will you feel limitations, dissatisfaction, and the need to do this and that. When you reach a state where you know you are the creator yourself, understand? If there is no lack, need or anything like that within you, when you reach such a state, you won't have any such thoughts and your own creativity or inspiration will flow continuously. These will support you. However, you are in a state of completely enjoying life. In that state, you can enjoy to your heart's content, then create and exert. And all of these will support everything you need in the material world.
If you need a studio, you will have the studio you want. If you need a house, you will have the house you want. Do you understand what I mean? Because once you get caught up in thinking that you need to do something, you are operating with your physical body. You are merely treating yourself as a physical body. If you only treat yourself as a physical body, there will be continuous and endless emergence of all kinds of needs and desires within you. Do you understand? Because once you have chosen to enter this mode. Just as I just told you, there are two modes. One is the natural and seamless mode, and the other is the mode where you only use your flesh to move. The experiences of the two modes are completely different. So when you choose to enter a natural and seamless mode, you won't have any sense of scarcity. Because you know that you are the Creator, and everything you need that is supportive will be presented before you. Just as if you were a creator, just as if you were a painter, when you are facing a blank canvas. 
You need to use your mind to manifest what is needed above. OK, I think my world first needs to have something like a castle or a farmstead. There are two chickens, a few geese, a master, and a servant. Do you understand what I mean? Your material world is actually the same.

**Question:**This reminds me of what he said in the Seth books, about Framework One and Framework Two. Framework One seems to refer to this material world, and Framework Two seems to refer to the realm that creates the material world.
**Higher Spirit:** Yes, because when you enter the physical body, you are actually only acting with your physical body. You are always restricted there. Do you understand? You will never have brilliant inspirations. You are always dealing with one thing after another in front of you.
Which matter is in front of you, deal with which matter.

**Question:**Then what needs to be done to reach the natural state you just mentioned?
**Higher Spirit:**Because many people still don't know what they want, understand? They don't know that what they think in their minds is actually sketching, painting on the painting. So they will project some fearful things or setbacks to happen in life because your inner fears will also be projected for you to experience your inner scarcity. For example, if you think you can't find a job, you think you have no money, then this idea of yours will be projected in the material world, and then you will experience it. It will be manifested through this state, such as not being able to find a job. This is actually your inner fear.

**Question:**Recently, what I have actually done the most is to listen to songs to relax. I am very happy to do this every day. Has it been of great help to me so far?
**Higher Spirit:** You are still entering a framework mode. You think, OK, the authoritative information or what that teacher said that life should be like this, and I have to follow this mode. Do you understand? I have to achieve this goal and reach this state before I am successful or something like that. Because there is no fixed mode here that should be like this or that. Instead, it is about truly achieving an inner harmonious state. So it can be a state that you show when you are busy, but you enjoy and are passionate about creating. Do you understand? Don't enter any boxes or frameworks. When you enter the framework, you will regard it as something that you use as a standard for everything. Then there will be conflicts and divisions within you. So why do you think such things are happening to me at present? Every path has some gifts that you can obtain from it, and it can be helpful to you.
You don't need to seem like you are checking the answers with me, saying, "Oh, is the direction I'm going in correct now? And is this thinking mode correct?" You don't need to do that because you yourself are a god, understand? You yourself are a god.

**Question:**I have another question. That is, I think I have been drawing Tarot cards more and more accurately recently. I want to know if this is related to the degree of my belief and trust in it? 
**Question:**I want to ask if my spirit guide has any other messages for me.
**Higher Spirit:** Whether there are any other messages that your spirit guide wants to give you is for you to enjoy and play to your heart's content, understand? Because you are inherently in a game park. Don't take everything as limitations or restraints, or things that make you nervous. You are just playing. It's rare to come to an amusement park. Just think, it's very rare for you to come to an amusement park. It's like you spent an astronomical price for a ticket and bought a pleasure boat in the amusement park. If you don't enjoy well, don't have a good time, and don't play to your fullest, always immersing yourself in: Ah, I'm going to walk this way, take my first step on the left, I'm going to do this and that. If you're always tangled up here, ah, will I trip, will I do this and that. If you get stuck here, the time for the amusement park is up. Because the time at the amusement park is limited. You say I haven't even started playing. How come it's over for you guys? Wouldn't you lose out big time?
So be like a child. As soon as you see something that attracts you in front of you, you pounce on it and have a great time. Play one and then run to play another immediately. Because the more you experience, the more worthwhile your life is. Otherwise, you'll lose out on your ticket. Your time is up. It's getting dark. You have to go home. This is the place you chose to go yourselves. You can ask something about depression because this girl has in her mind that she wants to ask. She has recently seen some information about depression and suicide.

**Question:**Then could you please talk about some of the questions about depression that you can perceive in this girl's mind? 
**Higher Spirit:** Because she has a special feeling, a special sense of connection towards patients with depression. Because she thinks that patients with depression are all a group of very, very, how to describe it, it seems like they are advanced seeds. They are all a group of very thoughtful, caring, dedicated, self-sacrificing people. They are all such people in her mind. But it's just that they are trapped in the physical body. Because they don't understand the operating mode of the material world and don't know their identities. They are trapped in the material world. So she wants to help more patients with depression. In your perception, you actually have no solution for patients with depression. Why? You either use medicine, and use medicine to make people in a half-dead state.

Although he's not dead, he's not really alive either, understand? Because you don't even have the ability to die that you once had, the energy.
So, why has your technology developed to the present, that is, in your eyes, it's very advanced now, and healthcare and medicine are also very advanced, but still can't save the hearts of depression patients who want to leave this world? Because mental illness can only be cured by the heart, understand? Medicine can't cure mental illness. Only the heart can truly awaken another person's heart. It can't be awakened by medicine.


**Question:**Then how can this heart be awakened?
**Higher Spirit:**Each of you is an expert in treating others. Each of you, it's not that only if he is a psychologist or he is a doctor, he can treat people.
 Gradually, gradually, one feels that this world, this garbage dump, is always like this and it will never be cleaned up.

**Question:**Then I want to ask, are these suicide patients with depression the soul design before their birth, or did they choose death in the end because they did not reach an agreement with their higher selves after coming to this material world?
**Higher Spirit:** The design before birth never designs a way of suicide, understand? 

**Question:**Maybe it's part of the design. I've heard such a statement. 
**Higher Spirit:** Suicide is like the example I just told you. After you bought a ticket and entered the amusement park, you wanted to leave before you even started playing. You chose to come to this material world, that is, you chose to come to this amusement park. You haven't played yet. You still don't know that you came to play. 
When you look at this amusement park and say: Wow, so many people, it's so chaotic. Look at this person, you push me and I push you. Something here is not quite right either. It's dirty there too. I'm leaving because each of you, depression, in fact, it is also expressing itself. It is expressing its dissatisfaction with this society. But he doesn't know that he has the power to transform because they think this is, always like this, fixed.
Your thoughts can project some negative aspects, and they can also project some positive aspects. So he forgets that he has the function of transformation, the ability to transform. He has been hypnotized by your material world. If he knew that the material world is actually a dream and everything seen externally is not true, and could have a broader perspective to view every matter and know that he himself has the ability to transform.
Then they would exert their talents very well because a person who can bravely face and end their life must be very courageous and have huge energy. So they just believed in some wrong things. So suicides are actually protesting against your era, that is, against your current situation. But they didn't choose to express their protest positively. Expressing the protest positively means that I initiate a model, let people see and imitate. Because your human imitation ability is particularly strong. Do you understand what I mean?

**Question:**🗎, Is it that everyone follows the crowd? Is that what it means?
**Higher Spirit:**Did you just mention suicide? Is it about the agreement of the soul? First of all, every one of you who chose to come to the material world, they all came to assist in the transformation. Of course, while you are transforming, you yourself are also transforming. This is mutual because no transformation is solitary. Just like I want to grow into a big tree and then the materials of my big tree can be used to build a house. While you are growing into a big tree and contributing yourself, you yourself are also constantly growing stronger. Then the soul is always, always, always in a process of evolution, in a growth, in a process of constantly expanding. So there is no fixed one. You can just set a small goal for yourself, but it's just a small goal for you to transform. Then that small goal is regarded by you as assistance. Do you understand? It's like if you say I'm going to Sichuan. Well, your going to Sichuan is just a goal. Can you consider it as your lifelong destiny? Do you understand what I mean? I'm just traveling to Sichuan for a visit and to have some fun. It's just one stop in my life. So don't consider a soul as a complete entity. That is to say, okay, his entire life only has this one topic. His life is also like one night of a soul. Just imagine. So although I know that death can't truly harm them, the true existence. But quitting the game early, ending the game prematurely, this is an uneconomical choice. You can have a better choice. Because the material world is really, really very suitable for you to grow and experience. And the restrictive experiences in the material world, the things that trap him, he will still continue to go through. 
So death doesn't set him free.

**Question:**I have a question. For example, if I die, because just like when I dream, I don't remember my current physical consciousness. Then will my soul still retain my current consciousness after I die?
**Higher Spirit:** You mean whether you will still have the current (memory) after you become a conscious entity then. Yes, for a period of time. Yes, it's a process. This is a process just like when you are dreaming yourself, right? When you wake up in the morning, you will still be groggy and reminisce about your dream, won't you? You will still reminisce about the situation in the dream again, and still clearly know what happened in the dream, right? But you won't be in such a state all the time, understand?

**Question:**Understand that when I'm not in this state, what state will I be in?
**Higher Spirit:**Imagine you wake up from a dream in the physical world. You will do other things. You will get up. Ah, I want to eat. I want to eat this. Where am I going to play today?

**Question:**Some time ago, I had a dream. In the dream, I remember someone would give me money, and then someone strangely gave me clothes. I found it very incredible. When going to the mall, she wanted to give me things. Then I want to know what message this dream is trying to convey to me?
**Higher Spirit:**The message conveyed is, as I just told you, you won't lack anything. Whether it's material or money, you shouldn't have this feeling of scarcity. Understand? 
你想,如果真正的你能达到呢种浑然天成,与神合⼀,就是你就是源头的呢种状态,你⾝边会吸引多少⼈,明⽩吗 因为你们物质世界有这样的⼈啊他们多少⼈给他拿钱啊多少⼈给他就是买机票去旅游去享受,邀请,这样呢样,是不是 所以你不需要有任何这⽅⾯的担忧你只需要去成为你真正的⾃⼰,以你激情的⽅式⽐如你特别喜欢画画,那你就疯狂的去画画,不去想明天的饭怎么办啊你觉得呢些像达芬奇他们在画画的时候会想过我明天没钱交房租了怎么办啊 明�You think, if the true you could reach that kind of seamless and natural state of being united with the divine, that is, the state where you are the source, how many people would be attracted to you around you, do you understand? Because there are such people in your material world. How many people give him money? How many people buy air tickets for him to travel, to enjoy, to be invited, like this and that, right? So you don't need to have any worries in this regard. You just need to become your true self. In your passionate way, for example, if you especially like painting, then you go crazy painting without thinking about what to do for tomorrow's meal. Do you think that when people like Da Vinci were painting, did they think about what to do if they had no money to pay the rent tomorrow? 白吗 他们在作画的时候有担⼼这些问题吗 他们全然的沉浸在他们想要创造的⼀种世界⾥⾯

He forgets everything even if I don't eat, understand? They are attracted to the world they created. When you are immersed in such a world, you don't have any feelings of scarcity. When you still have feelings of scarcity, it's because you are addicted to the material world.

**Question:**I have another question. A few days ago, someone told me in a dream that it would be a long time before you humans woke up. Then I was particularly angry and replied to him that humans were already on the way to waking up. This energy drove my body to say this sentence together, and then I woke up. I want to know what this represents.
**Higher Spirit:**Everything that happens to you, even if it's just a dream, you are a designer, you are a creator. You can define it and design a positive one to serve your information.
Then you will enjoy and consume the intention you defined. Do you understand? For example, you can say that the sentence opposite is a force pulling you, but in the end you firmly believe in yourself. In the material world in the future, you will also experience many voices contrary to you and at odds with you, do you understand? But you still insist on expressing yourself because that is the real you. Then you should know that only by being yourself and expressing your own true feelings can you not feel oppressed. Then you should be a person who doesn't feel oppressed. For any event, any matter, any energy, you can transform it into motivation to reach the direction you want. Do you understand? You are the creator. Don't hand over the power to anyone, not even us. 
Because we are also spectators. That is, we are also waiting for miracles. We are expecting you to create miracles instead of me telling you about miracles because you yourself are a miracle.

**Question:**Have you ever had a physical body?
**Higher Spirit:**The energy that is currently in contact with you has never had a physical body because we don't need to experience it. Understand? Just like in your physical world, when your level of consciousness reaches a certain degree, you no longer need to experience that kind of suffering, illness, or being oppressed or bullied because you will only experience the space with a similar frequency to yours.

**Question:**Isn't it said that consciousness is a process of growth? Then could it be that your consciousness was in a very powerful state when it was born? Do we have to grow up from babies?

**Higher Spirit:** There are also consciousnesses similar to ours that come to be human in the material world for experiences. It depends on what kind each of you chooses. Just like you, if you want to go there, OK. Although you are someone in the palace, but you want to walk into the alley to experience it, do you understand? Because you have this right, you have this freedom, you can have any experience.

**Question:**Then I want to ask, what connection do you have with aliens?
**Higher Spirit:** The difference between us and them is that we don't have any physical bodies now. We just exist in the form of an energy. This energy is not in a certain place. It's not that when I'm communicating with you now, I don't exist elsewhere. It can be everywhere, everywhere.
Because in your material world, matter is like you have a pair of scissors. If you give it to me, you don't have it anymore because you only have one pair of scissors. Understand? That's your fixed material world. Just like you, if you are at a friend's house today, then you won't be at your parents' house. Understand? That's the game of your material world. But in our dimension, it's not played like this, so we are not limited by space.

**Question:**Then I want to ask why the civilization of the inner earth people is so much higher than that of the surface people.
**Higher Spirit:**The civilization of the inner earth people is basically, basically, basically higher than that of your Earth because you humans are in a kind of detachment. It's like, how to say, you are separated, divided from the Creator, existing alone. Although some of them sometimes have links and perceptions, those people They have the strength and energy, understand? But generally speaking, the overall human race, they exist in a divided state. It's like, let's say, when you go bungee jumping, when you do bungee jumping, if the person who is connected to the Creator has the rope, they can jump freely, right? They can enjoy the experience. But you humans don't have the rope. Imagine how much you are doing to harm yourself and how dangerous it is. So you will have a sense of fear. You will be afraid that you will get hurt. You will hurt yourself. So you know that you can actually have a rope tied to your waistband and play to your heart's content. No matter what, you are protected.
You won't worry or be afraid. You know that no matter what, you are firmly tied up. You can freely show all kinds of poses and play to your heart's content. But at any moment, you have this choice. It's not that you don't have a choice. Because when you choose to have no rope, it's also your own will. Understand? If you think the experience without the rope is what you want to experience, you are also supported. This is how much support and freedom you get from the Creator. Even if you want to experience destruction, you are allowed. So especially for those patients with depression, if they know that they are always in such a state, that is, they always have a choice, and are always supported, advocated, and that (the experience) is originally just an illusion. They can always play freely. It's just that, possibly, for example, when others hear these words, they will think you are talking nonsense. They don't believe that some people will believe, and once they believe, they have power because that rope is invisible, understand? Invisible. Only if you believe can you experience that it is really pulling you. If you don't believe, it has no power. So when your information can really spread, not to mention spreading, because your brains will resist some information that doesn't conform to your own experience or routine. And in this way, it will awaken more depressed patients and let them create in a positive way and show themselves in a positive way.

**Question:**For example, now most humans are sleeping, and a small part are awake. Then for this small part of awake people, can their will continue after they die? **Higher Spirit:** You mean if an awakened person dies and a non-awakened person dies, is their experience the same? Because the awakened one remains awake and the asleep one remains asleep.

**Question:**Then for this awakened person, if he needs to be reincarnated next time, will this awakened state continue?
**Higher Spirit:** Will the awakened state continue? You mean when an awakened person chooses to be reincarnated again, **Question:** If it's an awakened person, is reincarnation a choice for him?
**Higher Spirit:** The people you mentioned who are awakened in the material world, he wasn't awakened in this life. He has already been awakened. He just found his memory. He just restored himself. Why is it called awakening? 
Imagine for yourself the meaning of awakening. He woke up from a dream and knew he was dreaming. So it's not that he said, he already has an awakened consciousness to choose a human body. For example, Buddha himself is an awakened one. He himself is an energy with a high consciousness. He chose a physical body. The physical body must go through an era of forgetting, experience forgetting, then remember again, and then recover. After recovery, he is awakening more people.


## 2021/06/15 - Sensitive energy body

**Question:**My first question is that sometimes when I lie down for meditation and gradually shut down my mind, there will be an energy rushing to my head. I can feel this energy. After getting up, my head will hurt very much. But I feel that this energy wants to come, that is, it surrounds me.
Then I want to ask what this energy wants to tell me or is it my guiding spirit or is there any reason? Thank you, 
**Higher Spirit:** Please wait a moment. I'll connect. What's your name? 

**Question:**My name is XXX. 
**Higher Spirit:** XXX, you want to know that when you were meditating, you felt an energy, and then this energy, do you want to identify what it is? 

**Question:**Yes, yes. 
**Higher Spirit:** What I sense is that your body is very sensitive, your energy is very sensitive. So sensitive that if you don't, that is, if you don't make good use of this energy, you are particularly prone to going into a kind of (state) of mental disorder. Because you are like one. Think about it if you have no skin, that is, those dust, those bacteria, those dirty things, those hairs on clothes, that kind of thorn, if it touches you once, you feel it very strongly. This is a very sensitive constitution of yours. This sensitive constitution is like a double-edged sword. It can bring you benefits, and it can also bring you discomfort. Do you understand? So, what you feel is that because you all are living here, there are many different spaces that are different. Because everything in itself is energy, vibration, and frequency. So what you feel is just a vibration frequency.

**Question:**Then I want to ask if this vibration frequency is higher than the vibration frequency of our material world, so that's why I have a particularly bad headache.
**Higher Spirit:** Because when you enter a state, you can sense that frequency. Then when many (people) do work like mediums, their bodies are a receiver. So you are the same. Then you can do this. It's like saying this is a signal. You feel this signal. You can go deeper. When you have a deep feeling, you can start to receive information. So, your body will become more and more adapted.

**Question:**Does that mean I need to practice this kind of meditation a lot and then I can master this technique?
**Higher Spirit:** It depends on yourself. You don't need to force yourself to do anything. Because it's not more about practice, but allowance and belief. Without inner fear. If you have inner fear, no matter how much you practice, you will only start to be irritable. So when you recognize that you will never be harmed in any way, you are always safe and you are connected to everything, that is to say, you allow the connection to everything. The way they appear, the way they present, you have no fear or resistance or terror. When you relax in such a state, then your body will increasingly, just like an electric current. Maybe at the beginning when you touch it, your whole body jerks because the body is not accustomed to it and regards this as a danger. But when you often feel this electric current and you are familiar with it, and you know it's an electric current and it won't cause any harm to your body, and when your body doesn't resist, then you won't have any discomfort.


**Question:**My second question is that this new boy I met has come back to me. I want to know if there are still any unfinished lessons for me to overcome through him. Because I saw him on the online media in our material world. I want to know what kind of person he is. Because I don't know much about him. Because I saw that he also followed a lot and a lot of girls on the online media.
**Higher Spirit:**It doesn't matter at all what kind of people they are. What matters is what kind of person he is in your world. Do you understand what I mean? For example, he is a bad guy in front of everyone, but you use your unconditional love to make him feel true love, and he decides to show you his most true and most true side. Because that bad guy identity is distrust of this society, understand? It's a kind of precaution. So there are no absolute good people and bad people in this world. What matters is your energy state will bring him. Because if you have unconditional love, you have no expectations of others. You don't expect them to be good or bad. You have no expectations. You just allow them to be themselves. You just trust. When you are still judging that he is a good person and I associate with him, and he is a bad person and I don't associate with him, you are putting yourself in a restrictive state. You can't really know who. Because all of you are here to grow, to learn, to experience. There is no good or bad here at all. All of you are allowed to use the way you want to experience. It's not that the way of experiencing is not beneficial. For example, this person doesn't know himself. Because the young people, is one who likes to be attracted only by the body, or what. Because he still has no understanding or acquaintance with the true attraction at the soul level or true love. He keeps seeking only physical attraction through it and throws himself into this physical attraction. After engaging in it eight or ten times, no matter what, he wonders why such beautiful bodies cannot truly make him feel love, feel oneness, feel... Then from these ten experiences, he can know what his true love is. Do you understand my meaning? Then these ten times are meaningful. Because through these ten times, he acquires knowledge, undergoes transformation, and achieves improvement. So you cannot take away these ten experiences he wants to have. If taken away and made into something like yours, like your religion says not to touch women. Or his parents tell him that he can't associate with just anyone. He will only become internally divided because he has this desire and this preference, but he can't do it, and then he will have conflicts. Do you understand what I mean? So all experiences are meaningful. Don't judge anything with your minds because you don't know what points they want to break through for themselves. But you can choose. For example, yourself. If you have the same assignment as him, do you understand? For example, when you were at school, you were assigned to this group. You and he were in a group and you did the same experiment. Then he was assigned to another group. If you were better, you would be assigned to a higher group level.
Finally, depending on what you yourselves want to experience and what experiments you want to do. Then be assigned to the same group. Then if you're not interested in his experiment and you don't want to join, then you can choose others. Well, if you think there are still things in this series that you want to experience or explore, then you can have a try. And you can also quit anytime: Oh, I think this isn't what I want or something. Then you can terminate and quit.


**Question:**I have another question. I had a dream that I had a lot of breast milk and was breastfeeding a child. The milk kept overflowing. Then on the opposite side of me, while I was breastfeeding, my parents kept persuading a man to marry me. Then this man was very reluctant. There were also several women beside. And I want to know what message this dream conveys to me. 
**Higher Spirit:** You dreamed that you were breastfeeding, and then your parents were chatting with someone else and asking him to marry you. What was your feeling in the dream?

**Question:**My feeling was that I was very surprised. Why was there so much milk? Then I can't remember the feeling at that time clearly. I just thought. 
**Higher Spirit:** Why are you interested in this dream?


**Question:**Because after I woke up, I checked the dream interpretations of people in the material world about this. It seemed to say that it was a pretty good dream, but I also knew this (interrupted by Higher Spirit) 
**Higher Spirit:** Why do you divide everything into good and bad? When you get into this being good or bad, you enter your mind again. Because your minds pursue pleasure and get rid of pain. In this way, you can't really, that is, if you want to create, if you want to learn, but you remove the obstacles to your learning. For example, if you want to build muscle, but you remove all the weights. Do you understand what I mean?
So here there is no such thing as good or bad. And if I tell you this is a very bad dream, would you be filled with fear? Then this is your bondage. Why do you have to believe others? Why can't you define for yourself what you want to experience in this material world? Instead of letting others, because others say it's a very bad dream, it's just because all that he has experienced, he has turned it into bad. Even if it's good, he has turned it into bad. Do you also want to be like him? You can ask other questions about your dreams instead of just one. If you have always been exploring a thing from the perspective of good and bad, what you need to let go of is the definition of good and bad in your mind. This is your problem, not how this event is or something.

**Question:**I understand. What I didn't hear clearly just now is from which perspective you said I could ask about my dream.
**Higher Spirit:**Don't ask about your dream from the definition of good and bad because if for every matter, just like your previous question about this man, that is, whether our relationship is good or bad, and whether this dream is good or bad, then you get trapped in your mind. What you should let go of is not the question of good and bad but to let go of pursuing the good and defining the good in your mind. This is your breakthrough point.

**Question:**Because once during a psychic communication, it was told to me that I still have many limitations, fears, and the like. He said that if I insisted on creating an illusion for myself, then I should create a positive one. So now I try my best to give a positive definition to everything I experience in the material world and in dreams. Then this positive aspect is a good definition for me. Am I doing this right?
**Higher Spirit:**You are asking this 
**Question:**Am I doing this right? You are still pursuing right and wrong. So you are still limited to right and wrong, good and bad. Because if this information is there, some people might only understand why such things happened in their lives on the day they die. Do you understand what I mean? It's not that you have to solve the mystery at every moment right now. Sometimes it's just a signal. But you will know this information when you need to know what that signal is. Otherwise, every day in your mind, even if you have a dream and start to struggle, start like this and that, and then when you feel a little uncomfortable, you also start like this and that. Then you will really miss your life. The most important thing when you come to this material world is every moment of your current life. For example, after you wake up from a dream, if you spend one day, two days, ten days constantly thinking about what that dream means exactly, then haven't you missed ten days of your life? During these ten days, you could have done many, many, many things. You could have gone to the garden to watch the little bugs. When you were inspired by the process of watching the little bugs and wrote many poems.  and So you need to take root in your life, your existence, everything in your present moment, that is, in this material world. Think about it. If you don't take root, how can you absorb nutrients, how can you grow, and how can you connect? You float. Keep talking. So regarding the information of this dream, then at least today we can let you see a dead end that you have entered yourself. Right or wrong, good or bad, and also that the psychic information has certain restrictions on you. Because I hope that the information we convey to you has no restrictions. It's not that you must do exactly as it says. You just follow yourself. Because when you follow the inner guidance within yourself, you can truly understand all the information. It's not that the psychic information says I should do this, and then I do it just like that. Then you are just superstitious because only through yourself, when your consciousness reaches a certain level, these psychic messages will really be useful to you, that is, you can really understand the true meaning of these messages instead of just following its dogmas.

**Question:**I understand. I may need to digest it later. **Higher Spirit:** It doesn't matter. Your consciousness will reappear in your mind or life when needed. At that time, you will understand better. So more importantly, just relax and enjoy your life, enjoy your life because this is not about completing homework, not a serious thing, not a thing to be tested. You have enough pressure and things to deal with in the material world. 
You don't need to put such pressure on yourself again. You should know that when you pursue something like wisdom in the spiritual world, like saying I want to be very wise, I want to have no fear, I want this and that, actually you are still in your mind. Do you understand what I mean? You are still in your mind. Why? You think you are not perfect, you think you are not good enough. You are still denying yourself.

**Question:**Another question is that I want to ask about the relationship between the free will of the ego and the planning of the Higher Self.
**Higher Spirit:** The Higher Self has no planning. It's not that it has a plan. Because the Higher Self you call is everywhere. It has no limitations. Only your ego has limitations. So if it can't experience here, it can experience elsewhere.

Other places can't provide the experience. He can have various experiences or creative ways in another place. Then you say it's the limitation of the small self. What you mean is the limitation of your physical body. The limitation of your physical body comes from the fact that your material mind has been pursuing good or bad, right or wrong, and good or bad. What is pursued is to reach a state of completeness or something better, or something else. Why? Because when you are pursuing something better, first of all, there is no such thing as better here. Why? Because in every present moment, it's not a forward path.
If you only see it as a path of moving forward, rising, and going ahead, with only the goal in your eyes, in fact, you have missed the present moment of life and every precious moment.
Why? Because you only have your eyes on the front. You don't look down. In fact, the underground is your front. The underground is your destination. Do you understand? It's when you lower your head that there is your destination. You keep staring at the front and running forward, charging forward. You think that if you don't charge, I'll fall behind. This limitation of the small self comes from your material world's understanding of life. You think that life is just like your physical body. But your life is much, much larger. Keep asking, because the more you ask, the more information flows in here.

**Question:**My this question seems a bit like the problem of fortune-telling in the material world.
**Higher Spirit:** You say, you can say any question. If there is no answer, then we won't say it here. You say.

**Question:**Because I'm still experiencing limitations now, and whether it's in freedom or in money, all kinds of this kind of limitations. Then I actually really want to know. If we have to look at it from the perspective of time, approximately how much time do I still need to break through the limitations? Because I think this problem is like fortune-telling.
**Higher Spirit:**You can break through right now. At this very moment when I'm talking to you, you can break through.


**Question:**I understand that I can let go when I see it. But in this physical world, for example, the house I'm living in now, it exists for real. And my physical reality is not like the spiritual realm where it can change to another place all at once. So I especially want to know, if possible, how long does the transformation of the physical reality that I experience still need? 
**Higher Spirit:** How much longer does it need? Do you mean asking me to tell you a time? 
**Question:**I know I shouldn't ask you like this. **Higher Spirit:** No. Why? If I tell you that you just have to believe that you will win the lottery or have an unexpected fortune tomorrow. You just have to truly believe without the slightest doubt and then immerse yourself in this kind of joy. What if I win the lottery tomorrow? When you can truly reach that kind of feeling as if you have completely received the money, do you understand? Instead of saying, "Oh, can I think like this?" "Oh, can I get a sum of money?" You will attract such things to happen in your life. This is the difference.

**Question:**Can I ask a question for the boy I know? His question is that he invested in a project, and at the beginning, he was particularly confident about this project and thought it could make money.
However, after some time, the project has been losing money. Then he was very hesitant, not knowing whether to continue following up or withdraw from it. Then the tarot card I drew for him was Five of Pentacles, which is about two beggars at the door of a church in the cold winter. Then I think his inner self wants to leave and is lacking, but he has the ability. As long as he believes he can change, he can change. But I know they won't understand and believe when I say so. So I don't know if I can ask such questions like fortune-telling in the material world.
**Higher Spirit:**There is no result here, no definite answer because events are always changing. And its changes are along with the transformation of people's energy and consciousness at present. So no matter what, it's definitely not that doing this guarantees you to make money and doing that guarantees you to lose. It's rather about a state of yours. Which direction will it develop? Your energy is the one generating power. How to put it? It's the engine. It's the core. Your thought, your energy. You don't think that you have to adapt yourselves to this world. Instead, you are transforming this world and controlling this world. Why can't you always understand this? However, what controls it is not your mind, but that inner force within you. I believe that. I'm going there. I don't care what obstacles there are. All obstacles are my motivation. I never thought it wouldn't happen. Then when you have this belief, that is, after you believe this thing will happen, you gradually influence the people around you. Ah, when your wife also believes in you and gives her wholehearted trust, she is giving you energy. Another friend of yours also believes and joins you. More people join, and more people believe. If the whole world believes, there will be an extra sun in the sky, do you understand? If you truly believe, there will be an extra sun. This is just a metaphor. So it is you who use your thoughts, beliefs, and energy to create this material world, not that the material world is fixed there. So in the end, how many people do you need to attract to believe in your dream and support your dream? Hitler wanted to kill how many people, do you understand what I mean? Even his idea was supported, and so many people came to support him and act with him. 
Including those victims who also support him, do you understand what I mean?
So the real, real obstacle is not this event, but rather how much influence your mindset has. Just like we said before, like I told you, how much do you believe, how long can you believe? Will you encounter some setbacks and have you wavered? Have you wavered and do you still have the strength? Think about your teeth. If it wavers, can you still use it to (bite things)? It has no strength anymore. So you need solid teeth to be able to bite things. Try with two wavering teeth, you won't be able to bite. It has no strength.


**Question:**Then this psychic girl has some problems. Her first question is why negative beliefs keep haunting us.
**Higher Spirit:** It's not that negative beliefs haunt you, but that you choose them. You think they are beneficial to you because your mind will only choose what is favorable and beneficial to you. So you have to ask yourself why you choose them. For example, there is a negative belief, just like you have a relationship, and you need to be cautious of others for this relationship to last. When you are being cautious of others, outsiders, that is one of your beliefs. And you think this approach can help you maintain the relationship. So it's not that this cautious act haunts you, but that you choose it to support you. Do you understand what I mean? All you need is more understanding and more cognition because why Your eyes and your mind believe that seeing is believing. For example, if you once saw your parents behaving in a certain way, and saw others behaving in a certain way, you will unconsciously enter a state where doing it this way is right, and slowly form a belief. Because you don't know there are other ways and no one has demonstrated other ways to you. So this is why you need more positive role models to demonstrate what true love looks like, or what a person who truly has wealth looks like, or what kind of whatever looks like. You need more positive and active role models to influence more people and let them see, because they only believe in what they can see with their eyes because you are in the material world. So as long as you figure out that the fear, harm, worry, and terror brought by this negative belief actually outweigh the benefits it could bring to you, and when you realize that you just picked it up elsewhere, you can let it go.
Your negative belief actually has another function, that is, it will prevent you from discovering the truth. Understand? Because when you find that you look inside, you will be scared. It's like a dark hole. You don't dare to look inside. You think there are demons in it, and you are scared of what might appear. You are afraid that if you take a look, you might fall in. You are afraid that if you take a look, you might be scared to death. You are afraid of what might appear. It's because this kind of fear will arise within you, and then it stops you from looking inside. Why? Because when you find that you look deeper and deeper, that is, with a more courageous obsession, when you look more, and there's nothing at all, then you start to think that I'm simply crazy, or something, something, something. When you discover that there's actually nothing inside, you let it go and you won't be affected or frightened by that dark hole anymore.
So why do you have a saying that says face your fears directly and don't run away. Keep looking down, and you will see that there's nothing inside. It's all in your mind.

**Question:**What you just said, it suddenly occurred to me that it was Yuan Wu Shi, that is, Teacher Yuan said, for example, when this kind of negative energy, negative feeling comes, face this energy directly, and when you completely feel this energy, tell yourself what the truth is. Then, using the power of thought to transform this energy, are all these statements from different perspectives referring to the same thing?
**Higher Spirit:**Because when you see that there is nothing inside, you don't need to transform it. It has automatically transformed. 
**Question:**This psychic girl wants to know what to do when you clearly know that your fear comes from a negative belief but still can't get rid of the fear.
**Higher Spirit:**As I just said, for example, I looked directly into that black hole and found that there was nothing inside, but you are still afraid. That means that inside you, because as I just said, when you discover that there is nothing outside and it all comes from inside your mind, it can only mean that there are still remnants in your mind, and there are still some other negative beliefs affecting you. 
You just need to further explore in this same way slowly. It's possible that, for example, I see there's nothing inside and I still have fear. Then, for instance, you keep looking and you see: Wow, originally I was worried that I don't have it now. But will I have it tomorrow? That there will be tomorrow is yet another negative belief of yours. So just use the same way, continue to explore, explore. And there's no need to push yourself, no need to force yourself to become a person without any fear because there's no need to pursue anything. Because what's present is the best. We won't use a perfect standard to expect you to quickly become so because life itself doesn't have an ending state, a perfect state.
We have no expectations of you. 
**Question:** The next question of this girl is that there are many similarities between our information and the information in "Conversations with God". "Conversations with God" is a book in our material world. Then she wants to ask if all these information come from the same place?
**Higher Spirit:**She has been reading "Conversations with God" recently, and a lot of information is from the information you received through channeling, that is to say, it's very similar, very alike. Then you want to know if this information comes from the same source. Then I want to say that all this information comes from the same place. That place is what? It is pure love, pure energy. Pure love all comes from light, from love, from God. Yes, it's like when you fetch water. You may fetch water from different wells. This water tastes a little different. But the source of the water, well water, the water from two or more wells comes from the same place, understand? Then they just use different ways, using the language they can understand. Because you have to turn it into your material language. You must have that way of expression in your material world in your own way.
Just like a well, it has different (unclear), it has geological influences, and it still has a slightly different taste, but the source is the same.

**Question:**This girl wants to know if she can open her eyes and have psychic abilities.
**Higher Spirit:**Currently, she can't open her eyes and enter the state. Why? Because when she opens her eyes, the phenomena of the material world, everything in the material world will pull her into the material world. This is a function of her body. Just like when you are in a dream, right? If you are suddenly awakened while dreaming, can you continue the dream? You can't. But there are many ways for her to convey information. There is a relatively deep state like this to communicate with you. But she also has her preferred way. For example, writing poetry is the same. It's just that the link for her to write poetry now is not as smooth as our current link. Do you understand? Then if she can convey information by writing poetry, she is in another state. But in fact, that information is psychic information. She perceives some, she perceives energy, perceives love, and then she describes it in her own language. 
Her state is that she just opened her eyes in her material world and then was describing.

**Question:**This girl has another 
**Question:**Are aliens divided into good and bad ones?
**Higher Spirit:**If you ask a bad person, and say, "Are you bad?" He'll say, "I'm a good person." If you ask Hitler, and ask him, "Are you bad?" He'll tell you, "I'm doing a correct thing. I'm optimizing humanity. I'm making humanity better. How could something that makes everything better be bad?" Do you understand what I mean? So good and bad are just different positions, from different perspectives. OK. For example, there is an alien who suddenly walks to your bedside. Then for him, he thinks you are a sleeping person. You are shrouded in all fears. You are in pain. He wants to help you.
But you might faint when you see him. He might give you an anesthetic first because they want to alleviate your pain during this process. You think you were abducted by aliens, and then he has to anesthetize you. But from his perspective, because his knowledge is more advanced than yours, he can see everything clearly.
He thinks he is saving you. So, whether it's good or bad in your material world, it's because you stand at different perspectives. You stand at your own perspective, and they stand at their opposite perspective. You have your own view of the event, and they have their view of the event. And the aliens are the same. But but but basically, the degree of evolution of aliens is higher than that of Earthlings. That is to say, if you really have to distinguish between good and bad, they are not bad. Because why the more highly evolved people are, the less they would use negative ways to experience and grow. Because they know it's unnecessary. Just like the two of you now, your consciousness levels are constantly improving. You wouldn't kill others or hurt others because you know you are actually one. Hurting others is also hurting yourself. You wouldn't make this choice. Even if you have the weapons to hurt people, do you understand? For those highly evolved and highly conscious people, only those with low consciousness levels, because in their cognition, they have no other means to solve problems, they would resort to violence. So simply taking away the violence of those who have violent tendencies or who show themselves through violence alone cannot solve the problem. That is to say, it's not about not allowing people to hit others. Instead, it's about enhancing their awareness. This is one of the purposes or meanings for you humans to come to the Earth and experience the material world. It's through such vivid and profound feelings that you come to know. Experiencing some negative feelings, you then know that you shouldn't do that. Because you have experienced it so profoundly. It's like this.
Rather than forcing all of you not to do bad things, it's about having a true and intrinsic quality within you. That is the real nobility. Imagine, a gentleman or a noble man. He appears to follow the model of a noble man to become one, but he isn't like that intrinsically. Can you feel it? Don't you have a saying called "hypocrite"? He is sincere from the bottom of his heart, and he is internally consistent. Only then can you truly feel him. That way is real. Only the genuine is infectious and influential. The internal is harmonious. Do you still have any questions?

**Question:**I want to know if my thoughts and ideas in my daily life are all known by my guiding spirit. That is, does he know what I'm thinking?
**Higher Spirit:** Your guiding spirit. First of all, your guiding spirit is not a fixed object. For example, now that I'm chatting with you, I am your guiding spirit. Then, does it know all your thoughts and ideas? If we are connected, it does. It is not a fixed object following you around to monitor or supervise you. Instead, it's like a student. The teacher, I have a problem here, and then the teacher comes over. Rather than having a teacher constantly behind your back, following you, waiting for you, and surrounding you.


**Question:**My last question is that I want to know what kind of state my synchronization with my Higher Self is at present.

**Higher Spirit:** What kind of state? Are you again using a yardstick to measure yourself? If you feel that you are inwardly in a state full of joy, happiness, and true love for life, this is synchronization. This is a standard. This is a yardstick. You can use this standard to look at your own state. But don't always pursue this state, understand? If you imagine that you want to skip all the growth and all the time and become such a person directly, aren't you a fool? So put aside any pursuit.

**Question:**This psychic girl still wants to know how we can better disseminate these high-dimensional information.
**Higher Spirit:**How you can better disseminate these high-dimensional information is that you, like us to you, as I just said, we have no requirements for you and we have no expectations for you. Then I also hope that you will have no expectations and no requirements for those who are still unclear and do not understand the information. Because once you have expectations and you have requirements, you will generate what - a sense of disappointment. Why don't they listen to me? My information is so good. You start to have a sense of disappointment. Then if your own state is a state of disappointment, imagine if you have benefited from our information?  and There is no such production. Why? Because you believe that life is eternal. You believe that they are experiencing what they need to experience at this moment. You respect the path they need to take, even if it is presented in the most evil way. Even if it is very inconsistent with your concept, your worldview. You just believe that they have eternal time to experience everything they should experience. All experiences are meaningful. Also let them know that it is your eternal understanding, eternal permission, eternal trust, and eternal love for them. Because when you reach such a state, it can be seen from your eyes and from your body as God. When he sees God, he lets go, understand? When he truly sees God, he gives up everything and stops harming himself or others in a negative way. 
So when any judgmental voices, or opposing voices, any blow arise in your mind, you shouldn't be like this.
In any such state, if you are an individual, you simply can't spread God's message. But if there isn't any such message in your mind and you just allow everything, he can recognize you. When he can recognize you, he has moved from darkness to light. So there's no need to painstakingly persuade or tell a bunch of big reasons. Instead, you yourself enter that state. It's you yourself. You are God.

**Question:**The girl's last question was that this information is like a treasure. Why are we so eager to share the treasure instead of hiding it?
This urge to share, does it come from God?
**Higher Spirit:**The information we give you is indeed a treasure for you. If you can recognize it as a treasure, and if you can't, it's nothing. So you think it's a treasure because you have this level of consciousness and have these experiences and all these experiences. You can recognize it as if you wore a pair of glasses and you could see. If you don't wear glasses, you can't see. Then why do you want to share this, that is to say, you saw it with glasses instead of just enjoying it yourself? Because it's like, let's say, in a dark room, you used these and you improved. You yourself became the light. Do you want to hide your light? You want to say that I can't let my light shine out. I want to possess it myself. I can't, can't, can't cover my light. This is impossible. Because in that process yourself, you are already, they are still dark, and you already have a faint light and then it gets brighter and brighter. This is the process of growth, the process of raising consciousness and transformation. It's impossible for you to go backward. That is to say, when you become transparent light, unless you yourself want to experience, that is, choose to do something to yourself, you are just an existence of light. And the true light and the true love, that is to say, when the degree of consciousness reaches a certain level, you are love. You don't mean that you need to get something or that others need to be in a certain way before you give. You are just love. When you are love, you will extend your hand when others need it. 
Because why? Because you are love. You will give your love when others need to go through pain. Why? Because you are love. So all the answers are that you are love. This is love. Then why is there a desire to share?
Because this is love. When others are seeking, I give it to them. Because this is love. And when others are thirsty, I give them water. Why? Because this is love. So this is love. God is love.


## 2021/06/16 - Why have you been constantly thinking of suicide?
**Higher Spirit:**When did you have this thought? How many times is this?
**Higher Spirit:**Since childhood. Why haven't you taken action yet?
**Higher Spirit:**So you don't really want to commit suicide. You just want to get out of your current constraints, that is, the current situation, the current predicament, right?
 For instance, if you can't find another way out and you think suicide is a way, do you understand what I mean? So your problem is not that you want to commit suicide. You're not someone who wants to commit suicide. It's just that every time you feel there's no way out, you think suicide is an option, understand?
**Higher Spirit:** It doesn't mean you want to commit suicide. **Higher Spirit:** This doesn't mean you want to commit suicide. You don't want to end your life. You just don't want to live under pressure, understand? If you don't even understand your own problem, that is, the thoughts in your mind, what the problem is for, if you don't even know these, you can't handle it. In this material world, your physical body, first of all, it's like you're hitting a shadow with a stick. Do you think it's useful for you to hit the shadow on the ground with a stick? 
So no matter whether you do harm to yourself, end your life or damage your life, you are just hitting the shadow on the ground with a stick. You can only do such an action. Try next time to take a stick. For example, if a person is standing there, the shadow on the ground is the one cast by the sun on him. You take a stick to hit the shadow on the ground and say you want to kill it. Just have a try.
**Higher Spirit:** It's not about how you obtain material treasures. It's because you already have material security. If you didn't have material security, could you still be talking to me today?
**Higher Spirit:** That's just an idea in your mind. What you need to deal with is not matters in the material world, but the ideas in your mind.
**Higher Spirit:** I'm not Seth. I have no name.
If you want to name me Seth, it's okay for you. You can.
**Higher Spirit:**What is crazy for you?
**Higher Spirit:**What is unimaginable for you?
**Higher Spirit:**Your material world's definitions of crazy, unimaginable, and abnormal are all wrong. How to be a normal person? You say they are crazy. A real killer devil, who is truly collapsed, split, and disguised inside, but you say they are normal people. So with the words of your material world, you can't define anything.
For example, many of you, even as teachers, or police officers, or leaders, they are all schizoid. On the surface, they have one personality to deal with your daily life, but actually hide another personality. 
But you all say he is normal.
**Higher Spirit:** If you want to be liberated, first you need to understand what makes you feel bound. Where do you get liberated from? You need to recognize the true you. The true you is without any form. How do you want to trap him? The only thing you can do now is to use your material mind, that is, the physical body of yours, and the consciousness of your physical body to create a lot of fears for yourself to experience. This is the only thing you can do. You can't bind anything, and you can't be liberated from anywhere. Do you understand? You can't even bind anything. How can you be liberated? So if you just regard yourself as this physical body,
**Higher Spirit:** You are in a dead state now, do you understand? Do you think you are alive? You are not. You are in a... state now.
Because of the energy in your body, your cells, everything about you is clogged. A living person, that is to say, he is permeable. And a dead person, he is clogged. For example, if you are alive now, that is to say, you are a water pipe, water can flow through your body, you can feel the water, you can experience the water, you can let the water nourish you, and then you can effectively pass the water to other places that need water. Then you are alive. But if the water can't get in here at all and you can't flow it out either, do you think you are alive? You are clogged. Then that is dead. How do you kill something that is already dead?
**Higher Spirit:**Because of what? It is because in your mind you always want to look for something meaningful. It is because your mind, it will define everything: meaningful or meaningless, good or bad, normal or abnormal.  
All experiences are meaningful.
**Higher Spirit:** Pain is also meaningful.
**Higher Spirit:** You haven't bought anything. You haven't spent any money.
**Higher Spirit:** What's the main reason you came here? What is the reason you want stability? The reason is to feel to what extent your thoughts are, that is, to look in the mirror.

**Higher Spirit:** Do you mean how to leave the Earth? How to leave the Earth? Do you mean your physical body? Then what do you mean? If you want to be liberated from your pain, then don't project terrifying or fearful images to yourself for experience.
**Higher Spirit:** If you are afraid, you are generating it. Your fear is nourishing it.
**Higher Spirit:** First, you should know that we are not here to comfort you, nor are we psychologists.
So any of your emotions, if you want to express them, you can find someone in the physical world who can listen to you. So if the information we bring to you is completely beyond your understanding, no matter how many times you reconnect, the result will be the same. First of all, you must clearly know exactly what you want. If you want to commit suicide, you don't need to tell anyone. You have the right to make any choice. But just let you understand that no matter how you want to treat your body, it's just like hitting a shadow with a stick because you can't cause any harm to it. If you want to spend this effort, you can try because you are allowed to use various ways to grow and experience yourself.  Because, it's the Higher Spirit in your mind: This is normal, **Higher Spirit:** Any questions? Where am I? First of all, I don't have a physical body. I'm just an energy. So, it's like when you ask the air, you say where are you? It's like when you ask a drop of seawater, the water in the sea, you ask this drop of water where are you? It's in the entire ocean. It's in the entire universe.
**Higher Spirit:** There are very, very many things you can't do because your physical body itself is limited. So the things you can't do or the things you can't achieve or obtain, this is very normal.
**Higher Spirit:** There is no future. It's not that you have no future. It's that everyone has no future.
**Higher Spirit:** There is no future here. You always think that your time is... like moving forward, one, two, three, four like this, this process. That's an illusion in your minds. There is no future here. Only every single moment. If you ask in which moment you will be happy or joyful, then this choice lies with you. In every moment now, you choose the experiences you have. No one can stop you from any experiences you want. So that's why it's very important for you to clearly know what you want. If you don't know, you will be influenced by external factors. You will be influenced by the collective consciousness and the majority state in society.

**Higher Spirit:**Do you have any more questions?
**Higher Spirit:**No one can solve your predicament because you are the only one who creates your predicament. You are also the only one. Just like your feet are on your body. If you are not willing to step out, no one can force you. Understand?  Why do such a thing? It's because it seems that your body, some cells or energy in your body right now are in a blocked state. Then, when you truly integrate with music, especially music with a strong sense of rhythm, that means you have reached a connection with the outside world. Because if you have no connection with the outside world, it's as if you yourself are in a, like a transparent ball, for example. If you are inside, if you want to interact with others, your warmth cannot be felt by them. That is, there will be a barrier between you, and there is no sense of connection between you. That is to say, it's like you're dealing with people in a glass house, so the other party can't feel your warmth, nor your love, nor that you are, in a flowing state. When you learn to integrate your body with the music, your body is, you are teaching it to connect. Because you have to follow the music, your body, is to let the music and those rhythms enter your body. It's like you are an insulator now, and you need to turn yourself into a conductor. Because in this way, when you come into contact with everyone, there will be a connection between you. Because imagine if you want to touch someone's heart, or walk into someone's heart, or want to change or have any influence. If you are insulated, how can you influence the other party? So this is what you currently need to connect. It's to make your body, all those clogged, numb, or tense parts, reconnect completely. Make your body reconnect with everything, such as having a connection with people, with your inner self, with plants and animals. In this way, you can no longer just act based on your schedule. Because currently, it seems that you are following a textbook, as if you have a schedule of what to do every day and you act based on that instead of following, for example, the place you work, you haven't integrated with it. The objects you work with, the people you face, you don't have a strong sense of connection with them. It's like there's a saying that it's very official and matter-of-fact. So you will feel that, although you have done a lot of work. Imagine that you are in a glass. You have done a lot of work and made many efforts.
But you have no great influence on the outside world because there is a layer of glass between you. So this is a kind of internal sense, that is, to make your individual be a receptive state, that is, you can accept the other party's state, and then the other party can receive your state. Because when you influence others, it's like, for example, the other party is ice water or cold water, and you are boiling water. Do you understand what I mean? If you achieve that kind of connection, then you will heat him up. If you don't have a connection, he is still ice and you are still boiling. They can't melt together. Then because currently, your body is very much, that is to say your own body is a guarantee. Your body has tremendous wisdom and everything you can utilize, but you have developed it very little. Because when you are a truly true teacher, a teacher does not talk about the knowledge in his mind, not the knowledge he has stored and learned from books, but rather he himself is like a pipeline. He transmits the wisdom and energy of the universe through him, just like others come to you to draw water. You are just like a well. If you only have the knowledge in your mind, then the water in your well is like stagnant water when giving it to the other party to drink. Do you understand what I mean? Then if you make your body like a receiver, you are open and you are constantly receiving energy, and you download all wisdom in the present moment. Then you are like a living well. The water in you is alive. The well water of yours is constantly available. The more people take it, the more water you have. And it is vigorous and can nourish people instead of being a pool of stagnant water where many bacteria breed.
Because the knowledge stored in your minds, all these in your minds are stagnant water. So you need to open up that channel. After opening it up, you will find that the true wisdom can be obtained immediately at present and you simply
don't need any of the rigid things learned from books. Because if the other person knows that you have stagnant water, there will be a kind of thought in his mind and he won't want to continue absorbing those. And this way will only create more of those wells of stagnant water like I just said and the other person will also become like that. When they leave this kind of situation, for example, you teach him to react in this way. If the other party doesn't make such a reaction, he will be at a loss. He doesn't know why because you have made him like a robot. You input this program to him, and he can only answer with this program. If it exceeds the scope of his answer, he doesn't know what to do. Such a person cannot make any creation. The things he can make are very limited. You need to turn each one into a real one. Like what I just said, what flows out of it is a well of living water.
Such a well of living water can nourish everyone he meets around him, as well as his customers and everything he comes into contact with. 
**Question:**Then can I abandon some of the knowledge in my mind before? **Higher Spirit:**Knowledge is like a tool. You can, if you have wisdom, understand? You can use it well. It's like if you don't have good wisdom, when you use it, it will only become yours, as if it's an obstacle that will block you. Why? Because it will prevent you from connecting with wisdom. So, it's not that you have to shield the knowledge in your mind, but that you understand that knowledge is like a tool. When you need to use that tool, you pick it up. If you don't need it, you put it down. It's like a knife. A knife is a tool. When you need to use the knife, you pick up the knife. If you keep holding that knife in your hand all the time, will it affect your personal life? Will it become a burden for you?
It will affect you. For example, when you want to go to sleep and you still hold it, when you want to play with your children and you still hold it, it will affect your own life and might also hurt others. For instance, because knowledge is always in the past and it is dead, but the present is always creating something new. Only in the present can you create something new. If your child creates something new in the present, but you view or treat him with those dead things, and lecture him, you are hurting him with a knife because you have murdered and erased his innovative thought. So, it's not about whether to let go or not to let go here. Rather, it means that when you have, that is to say, when you enhance your cognition and when you possess wisdom, you will know when to take out all these tools and when to put them down. It won't become an obstruction for you but will become your assistance. Are there any other questions?


**Question:**The second question is how to enhance one's consciousness? **Higher Spirit:**Firstly, when your consciousness is limited, you cannot enhance anyone else's consciousness because you cannot see what problems there are in the other person's consciousness. It's like you are in a maze and you are the same as others. You are at the same level and you are looking at this world with the same color of glasses. How can you tell others that the color of the world you see is foggy? First, you need to take off your own glasses and you can see a real world.  and However, every breakthrough you make, your own breakthrough is for the entire collective, your human collective consciousness. Because imagine, all the thoughts and opinions in your mind right now are the thoughts and opinions of all humans in your society. Why do you think the same way as them in your mind? Understand? Because their thoughts, some of their ideas and concepts are influencing you. This is called collective consciousness. So when you are changing, you have already changed everyone around you. So you don't need to deliberately do something to change. They have to be influenced by the light and love you emit. Even if they are in the dark, if you shine. 
**Question:**So that means when I'm changing and improving myself, **Higher Spirit:** So that means there is no external factor here. Only you yourself. Only you yourself. The only one you can help is also only you yourself. Of course, when you help yourself, you also help the entire humanity because force is always two-way, there is no one-way. Just as you are making yourself, you understand yourself, know yourself, and then break through yourself, the entire humanity benefits. Just as you are a tree, you are constantly growing, and then the flowers you bloom, everyone can smell your fragrance. The fruits you bear will be shared with the entire humanity. If you observe nature, all of you support each other. You are a whole instead of a single existence. So no matter, that is to say, you have a saying that you reap what you sow. That is to say, no matter what you do to yourself or to others, it always, always mutually influences each other. Rather than there being only a single influence, for instance, only affecting yourself. So your self-denial of yourself is actually a denial of others. If you don't love yourself, you actually don't love others either. So when you love yourself, you are also loving others. When you affirm yourself, you are also affirming others. Do you understand this relationship? When you have this concept, you will gradually discover in your life that you will increasingly notice this close connection between you all, this sense of connection. You will regard yourself as an individual, that is, act as one person. What you see is the entire whole. At that time, you can truly be such that every step you take is for mutual progress, mutual growth, and mutual breakthrough. The next question is: How to become a good training teacher?
**Higher Spirit:** Training is a word only in your material world. Training means to cultivate what is not into what is. But here, I tell you now, you originally are. You just mistake yourself for not being. Do you understand what I mean? For example, I tell you that you yourself are originally a wise person. You are one with wisdom. You know everything. You have all wisdom, energy, and everything. But now you have made yourself into not being. Do you understand? Why? Because that's how your material world teaches you. You have to learn this professional knowledge. You have to do this. You have to do that. On the contrary, you have turned yourself into someone who doesn't have the two words "cultivate". It's just that you need to recognize what doesn't belong to you. A process of your life growth is to recognize, when you were a child, for example, in your parents' eyes or in others' eyes, the concepts of how a person should be, the collective consciousness, and the definitions in your mind that are not correct. You have to recognize them clearly through these layers of restraints and illusions to figure out who you truly are. Only after you see this can you see others. Because each of you is a fake person, an illusion, a false image. They are originally like this, but now they have become something else. And you are still continuing in this direction to cultivate them to be even more unlike themselves. So your actions, the things you can create are so limited, and your actions are so hindered. That is to say, it's not about becoming something, or transforming the other party or yourself into a certain way. Instead, it's about restoring your original state, remembering who you are, remembering your true identity. And because your true identity is not just your physical body. What you need to remember and know is this: You are not just your physical body. If you only regard yourself as a physical body and act in this material world, you will be filled with fear. For all your actions, that principle, there will be a sense of fear inside you driving you. For example, you will be afraid of facing unemployment, being fired, or not achieving performance. All kinds of fears are dominating you. Your behavior doesn't express the true you. So you must know your true identity. You are not just a physical body of yourself. You also have a higher existence of yours, and that existence is eternal. There is a saying called the unity of heaven and humanity. Right now, you just consider yourself as a human being. If you know that you are heaven and when you unite with your human self, you can do anything, that is, create anything you want to create. You can show anything you want to show. Do you understand what I mean? This will be explained in more detail later to help you understand. Because you have very little understanding in this aspect, but I have already expressed what I wanted to say, that is, all these to you. Then she downloaded it for her. 
She can explain to you in more detail further. Do you have any other questions?

**Question:**As a trainer, what is the best gift we can give to others? **Higher Spirit:**I think you should change your name in the future. You are not a trainer. Call yourself a master or a gardener. Just because you think so, the people you are going to train, that is, the people you are going to help, they all have many chains on them, binding their hands and feet, and restricting their minds. You need to remove these. Do you understand? Then this is not called a trainer. What kind of teacher is this? You can think about it yourself. Well, but if you want to achieve this, you must start with yourself. That's why she just told you that your energy is not flowing.
So you need to first allow yourself to be able to gesticulate freely, just like dancing easily to let your energy flow within your body and reach such a state. Then regarding this, I have downloaded it for her. As for other questions about this information.

**Question:**Other than that, is there any other information that you need to convey to us?
**Higher Spirit:**The information conveyed to you is that your work, your real work is to be yourself and come alive. This is your primary task. Because only after you do your real work well can it assist your current existing work. If you only focus on your current existing work, what you can do and show is very little, and what you can help is also very little. So your real work is to find your true identity and be yourself. First of all, you need to know that your constitution is a relatively sensitive one. A sensitive constitution means you'll find that you often have this phenomenon and this experience. So, it's like in the physical world right now. You see anyone and you get used to it. That is to say, when walking on the street, it's normal to have people on the street. Then you see there are animals and houses, and all these are normal. But if you have a sensitive constitution, you'll see other beings. It's like some people can see ghosts, right? Seeing them often, seeing them often, they'll also get used to it. But if every psychic person keeps asking why I can see this ghost, why I can see this ghost, you'll never finish explaining, understand? It's like you are a radio. You are just in the state of opening and receiving. You suddenly receive this, receive this channel. So if you want to explore more in this aspect in the future, then you can continue to maintain your frequency. That is, don't disconnect. Then you will receive more information. But it depends on whether you want to disconnect or connect yourself because you can choose. Because when you choose to open this channel, more and more beings will come to you. Because imagine that this is the same as the material world. For example, if you tell everyone that you are a psychic and you can help them connect with their deceased relatives, won't many people come to you after knowing that, right? It's the same in the spiritual realm. They will also come to you when you open yourself.

问: 我想知道你能不能关于我要去体��⼀份新的⼯作也好或者说新的赚钱⽅式也好,对于这个新的体验,⽬前为⽌有没有什么⼤的限制性的信念或者是束缚在影响这种体验进⼊我的⽣活⾥



**Higher Spirit:** You want to go to work and make money. Has your personal belief affected you at present? It's like you are walking forward, and then you want me to tell you if there is anything blocking your way in front of you. Wouldn't you know if you just walk over there yourself? You haven't taken a step yet. You come to ask others if there is something blocking your way first. Why are you afraid that it will block your way? You should ask yourself why you are worried that there will be something blocking your way. Because if you believe in yourself that you have feet, strength and solutions.
Just what if it blocks you? If there's something blocking you, you can use your hand to remove it. If you can't remove it, you can use your foot to do it. If it's too heavy, you can ask others to help you remove it. Do you understand me? So you just need to feel at ease and boldly go to experience, to walk, and choose the direction you want to go.
Instead of not even starting to choose the direction, not even taking the first step, you ask me if the road ahead will be smooth. Are there any obstacles ahead? Will it be terrifying? Oh, if terrifying things happen, then forget it. I'd rather not go. Isn't that basically how most people live?

**Question:**My next question is, I want to know that when one thing happens it is neutral, and then we go to experience As for me, I might define a desired experience for this neutral thing. For instance, for me, it might be a good experience. So I define a thing in a good direction and my mind pursues the good, that duality of good. Are they contradictory? Because the last psychic told me that my biggest limitation now is that I'm pursuing the good, but I don't particularly understand this. That is, I give a good definition to a thing, a positive definition, and pursue the good in my mind... I don't know exactly how to ask this question... **Higher Spirit:**Do you want to know the difference between pursuing the good and defining it well in your mind? **Question:** 🗎 **Higher Spirit:**What you define in your mind, we always say that you will experience what you define in your mind. In fact, the most important thing is not what you define, but rather that you yourself are in that frequency, that state frequency. That is, the true frequency. For example, you keep saying in your mind: Ah, this is a good thing, this is a good thing. But you are constantly, in your heart, very worried. The worried state in your heart, you are just deceiving yourself. Because if you really are, that is to say if you don't do that for one thing, really you, just take one thing and say that, knowing that everything is to serve you and is good. Then you basically won't want to have any kind of definition in your mind. Just like what was just said, because you have a complete kind of trust in life. You trust yourself, you trust life, that everything it gives you is supporting you, and you also trust yourself. Even if there is an obstacle that appears, then you also have the ability to remove it. 
The most important thing for you to reach the place you want to go is your own state, not what's in your mind or what you say with your mouth but how you live it out. It's you yourself. You are in that state. No matter what you say with your mouth, you can, understand? You can say nothing. You can think nothing. But you are just in such a state. This is the most important.

**Question:**The next question is that I saw Julia Wang say that our minds, our thoughts have a 35% power to change destiny. Then I want to know that you all have always said that we are the creators and destiny is in our own hands. So if there is only a 35% power to change, I want to know why this is the case. Secondly, can this proportion be increased?

**Higher Spirit:** Why would you believe what others say? We psychics have said many times that no matter what others say, it's true whether it's Julie Wang or a homeless person, just a nobody. He's nothing, and what he says is also true. Do you understand what I mean? What he says is true because that's how he experiences it. It's real in his world, but what does their world have to do with you? Although you share a world, you are all in your own world. Do you understand what I mean? When you only believe his words, then you join his world, have a common experience with him, and then his words can affect you. So everyone's words are true not because he is a psychic. What he says is true. Even if it's an extremely stupid person or a mental patient.
What a mentally ill person tells you can also be true. Why don't you believe it? Because what they experience in their world is exactly what they say. They say, "Look, there is an angel with two wings up in the sky. It's talking to me. Heeheehee. It's laughing. Why don't you believe it?" But what they experience is real. So, what you must remember is that you are not in the same world. OK. Just like in the current material world you see this world because all of you have the same belief system. You all believe the same thing. That is, you all have the same system installed in your minds. It's like in this game of yours. You all have the same program implanted. Then you can have the same experience. But you should know that in your same space, there are others. This is why it is said that there are other dimensions. This space also exists simultaneously in other dimensions. Psychics can perceive it. That is to say, those people with particularly sensitive senses can feel it when they open their senses, but you can't. Why? Because you don't believe. That is, the program has not been implanted in your minds. Do you understand? Because for you, there are no spirits or ghosts. So you can't sense them. Why can psychics have psychic abilities? Because they believe that they can receive information and communicate with people from other worlds. Because they believe it. Can you find a psychic and say that he doesn't believe in the spiritual realm? If he doesn't believe, he can't experience it. So a good psychic believes 100% in anything he feels and receives. So, your current problem is not about who said what, whether someone is trustworthy or not, or how things are. 
Rather, it's about why you would believe some authoritative information or if they have something, such as the ability to communicate with the spirit world or predict the future, and then you believe everything they say. It's not like that. This is what you should think about. That is, why do you think someone is powerful, and then believe everything they say? Even we, we all tell you not to believe us completely. You create by yourself and experience the material world. No one is absolutely correct. No matter how right they are, that's only in their world, their experience, their, um, their flat world, their universe. But you create yours. You create yours, and it's unique.

**Question:**My last question for myself is, I want to know, maybe perhaps all this information was given to me by them. But I still want to ask if there's any information that my spirit guide or my higher self wants to tell me.
**Higher Spirit:** You want to know if there's any information for you. All the information just now was for you. This information is all you need at present. Even if you are now in contact with the Creator, with energy, with God, that is, with the highest source, when you are in contact with such energy, it tells you not to completely obey it. You create yourself. Then why do you still always choose some people you think are very powerful, and then believe everything they say? Because of all the information, all the information, I say that even if he is not an expert or an authoritative person, even if he is a mental patient, his words are true. So you are not here to verify whose words are true and whose are false because they are all true and all false. It depends on your choice.

**Question:**I suddenly thought of a problem. I suddenly thought that last week, when I was adjusting the frequency, I felt that energy. That is, sometimes I would feel an energy that rushed into my head and I would feel my head very swollen. Last week when I felt that energy, I relaxed. After I relaxed, I gradually heard the sound of music. Then I don't know if it was auditory hallucination or if I really heard it. I heard a male voice telling me: Son, hold on a little longer. 
I want to know. Maybe this is the same as the answer you were going to tell me for the first question.

**Higher Spirit:** Yes. When you open up, it's like the more switches you turn on, the more you receive. You can link to anything and capture anything. But you just rest assured that you won't miss any information. Because it's like you are in your world. You are in your material world. There are so many scenes, so many people, strangers, and so many events happening. Do you understand what I mean? If you delve into each one for a long time and keep asking why, why.

**Question:**The next question. This psychic girl wants to know why blind people can't see in their dreams either.
**Higher Spirit:** Why do blind people dream and still can't see in their dreams.
Because when you are dreaming, your consciousness is still active or it's still your body. If you leave your body, can't you dream anymore? And if you are still in your body, blind people are still using their bodies. So when they are dreaming, their perception is still the same as their perception during the day, that is, it's still the same as when they are awake. That is to say, if the program used in your body is this one, then in both the on and off states of you, it's still this program. Unless you change one, that is, you think this program is no longer suitable for you and you want to change to another one. For example, you chose to drive at first, and the functions of the car are these. Then you want to experience others. For example, if you want to fly a plane, what are the functions of the plane?
So, only by changing his body can he have those functions to support him. But blind people can see. It's just that you don't have a common, how to say it. If he tells you about his world, you yourself can't imagine it. Do you understand what I mean? Because it's like there is no such program in your system. He told you something that doesn't exist in your program. Because if you close your eyes, you can still have images. For instance, if you touch a pillar, you know it's a pillar. But in the world of blind people, it's not the same pillar. So, just like what was said earlier, although each of you seems to be sharing one world, that is, in the same world. But you are all completely in your own worlds. You are not in the same world. Each of you has a unique perspective to feel this world. So why is each of you unique? Each of you is precious. Each of you is unique. Because imagine, when making a movie, many cameras and different camera positions are needed to shoot different scenes, right? Each of you is like a camera, experiencing this world from your perspective and identity. Then all these experiences are collected. Imagine how unique it is. Because why are there some disabled people? Because think about it, if your eyes are open, you will be disturbed very much by the outside, the material world. When you are subject to too much interference, you can't do it. For instance, if you are outdoors where it's very noisy, with all kinds of sounds, all kinds of people flow, cars, and various noises, and you want to listen to a certain sound, you can't hear it clearly.
For example, if you want to listen to someone singing, how can you hear it in such a noisy environment, right? Then if all the noises are removed, can you fully enjoy the beautiful singing? As for the kind of interference of the blind, imagine if he is in the material world with his eyes open and is subject to all kinds of interferences, how can he focus on a certain thing. Do you understand what I mean? So we, it's just like each of your cameras is in a close-up. This is the meaning of your existence. Because each of you is the eye of the Creator.

**Question:**When doing things, there is always a voice in the mind. Where does that voice come from?
**Higher Spirit:**When you are doing things, there is always a voice in your mind. Where does that voice come from? That voice comes from yourself. For example, when you are talking like this now, but you think that when you open your mouth, you can still talk like this. Do you understand what I mean? So you just use, like sign language, that is, without making a sound, that is, there is no sound in your mouth but you are making a sound in your heart. You can also choose to speak it out. You just think that if I speak out, I might hurt others or affect others. Do you understand? I might be considered crazy by others if I speak out. So you choose to speak in your mind. But that still comes from yourselves. You keep talking. 
**Question:**I suddenly have a question. I want to ask about the speed of manifestation in the material world, whether it is fast or slow, and what it has a direct relationship with.
**Higher Spirit:**What is the relationship between the speed of manifestation in the material world, whether it is fast or slow?

**Question:**🗎, What has a greater influence on it? Or what should we do to manifest faster?
**Higher Spirit:**For example. For example, if you ask a specific question. 

**Question:**For instance, if I want to manifest a lifestyle or a way of making money that I like, and then I want to know that this kind of manifestation requires in the material world, because the spiritual mentors of the material world say that you need to (interrupted) 
**Higher Spirit:**You have it right now. You have it right now. You just can't see it. So what you need to do is not to say it hasn't arrived, but to say you can't see it, because your level of consciousness determines what you can see, understand? Just like, for example, you say I want a lot of flowers, I like flowers, but in front of you is a pile of feces. You don't know that there are the seeds of your flowers in the feces. You just don't know. And it's precisely this feces that can make your flowers grow very brightly and lushly because it's fertilizer, do you understand what I mean? It's because you can't see the essence, that is, you can't see the real essence.
What you see is an illusion, and that illusion is projected by yourself. So there is no such thing as fast or slow manifestation here because you only have the present. You only have the present. What you are experiencing at the moment and what you need to experience at the moment are the most precious. Just to say that you can't see it or recognize it. Why? Because you are at different frequencies. That is to say, there is a saying that one thought leads to heaven and one thought leads to hell. What you need is not to change the environment you are in, but your state of mind, your personal state, and your feelings. Because when your state and feelings change, you will experience a different world. So it doesn't matter what the outside is. What matters is your own inner state. Just like, for example, even in the palace, your British Princess Diana, she lived in the palace. She had beauty and she had everything. But she was collapsed and very painful. Do you understand what I mean?
If the outside could determine her state of happiness or well-being, then she must be a very happy person. Why does she have such a painful life? Because she has everything. She has everything that people in your material world dream of, such as power, status, wealth, and beauty. What doesn't she have? She has everything. So the important thing is not what you want to make the outside look like, but what you are like inside. Because Buddha or those like Krishnamurti, those enlightened ones, they don't have a luxurious or extravagant life state. Do you understand? On the contrary, they have nothing in the material world. You continue to speak.

**Question:**But for example, like Buddha and Krishnamurti, it's their choice not to have these. But when they reach such a state inside, if they want, they can also have everything they want in the material world at any time if they wish. Because it is the inner that determines the outer. Do I understand this correctly?
**Higher Spirit:**Because for them, they already have everything. For them, he has everything he needs, not what his mind wants. Only your minds, your material minds, need so many things. Your souls don't need them. Your souls are just to experience, experience, experience.

**Question:**Well, does this kind of thing, this desire that the material mind needs, conflict with spiritual practice?
**Higher Spirit:**Whether there is a conflict depends on yourself. It depends on yourself. If you can satisfy all of your own and be in a happy state, you can. Understand? There is no whether it is okay or not here. You can experience everything you want to experience. All are meaningful


**Question:**Another netizen wants to ask if the universe has a boundary. If so, what is its shape? Is there anything larger than the universe?
**Higher Spirit:**Whether the universe has a boundary, it's like, how to describe it. Imagine the air, the air you breathe. Do you think it has a boundary? Energy is everywhere. Because first of all, if you want to talk about a boundary, you first need a space, right? But there is no space or time here. When there is an existence without space, you continue.

**Question:**The next question. Someone wants to ask if paranoid schizophrenia, that is, delusional schizophrenia, is not a real mental illness because their social functions remain quite good and they seem normal like normal people, only with some delusions. Moreover, general medications for treating mental illnesses are ineffective in improving their delusions. This netizen believes that for paranoid schizophrenia, psychological counseling methods should be used for treatment instead of medication. Is this correct?
**Higher Spirit:**Because first of all, your human definitions of mental illness and normal people are incorrect, and so is the concept of delusion. What is a delusion? Everything you experience in this world is your delusion. The house you live in is someone's delusion. The mobile phone you use is someone's delusion. Understand? Imagine, hundreds or thousands of years ago, if you said my mobile phone, I have something like this... Then I can hear from all corners of the world whether others think you are being delusional. First of all, your question is flawed. What is a normal person? If it's a truly normal person, a truly normal person, they have no fear, no worry. They only have joy. They are healthy and joyful because they know they are like flowers. They know when they should germinate, they know when they should blossom. They know this is me.They won't be anxious or worried about how they bloom. They won't be afraid of blooming either. They won't be jealous that others are more brilliant than them. Do you understand what I mean? This is normal because they know they are supported by the Creator. There are butterflies, rain, and sunlight. Everything they need is there. Such a state is normal. But how many people in your world are normal? Mentally ill. When it comes to mental illness, their world is also real, but you just don't agree. If more people agree, then it's normal. Your next question asks: This netizen wants to know how a woman who has been menopausal for several years can get pregnant.
**Higher Spirit:**If you have been menopausal, that means your body no longer has reproductive function. How to get pregnant? Then you need to change your perception of pregnancy. Because in medicine, there are many ways for infertile people to have children, and even men can have children. Haven't you had such cases? So again, what is a child for you? If a child is a soul joining your life, then you can have various ways to invite a soul to join your life. Just need you to let go of the definition of having children because your human material minds will have obsessions, that is, this person must come into my life in this way, but it's not like that. This is restricting, restricting yourselves. Because the soul, for example, many, many of their own children have no sense of closeness at all. Because why? Because that soul just wants to come to this world at this time, through this time, understand? And then be so close to people without any blood relationship. So your minds should have more understanding of this instead of saying that only those with blood relationship will be like this or that. And in your society, there are already very, very many examples of having blood relationship but hating each other mutually. 
Although there is no blood relationship but love each other so much. 
**Question:**I suddenly thought of a question, that is, I want to ask you because I had a remote relationship with a boy some time ago and now we are separated.
Then I found that it is relatively difficult for me to be myself in the relationship. That is, I still want to. For example, if there is a requirement that I am not willing originally, but the other party will really want it and I may want to meet the other party's requirement. Then this kind of my behavior in the relationship that I can't insist on myself very well, is it because I don't love myself enough?

**Higher Spirit:** Do you want to find out the reason why you have such a reaction?
**Question:**Yes. 

**Higher Spirit:** What will happen if you find it? Will you change if you find it? 
**Question:**If I find it, I think I should. I want to change.

**Higher Spirit:** Will you be happy if you change?
**Question:** Maybe I will get the result I want more... I don't know... 

**Higher Spirit:** So you need to ask yourself step by step like this. When you ask yourself, you can answer yourself. When you ask yourself, just like you did just now, you will laugh out loud. I can only tell you that it's just that you haven't met that person yet. Because when you meet that person, you don't need to change anything. You can get along in any way you want. You won't make any mistakes no matter what you do. So don't look for reasons in yourself. It's just that the time hasn't come yet. It doesn't mean that you have to be so perfect and work so hard to maintain a relationship, do you understand? That means that relationship itself isn't yours. 

**Question:** The next question is that this netizen wants to know that all major religions require people to help others and be selfless and dedicated (interrupted)
**Higher Spirit:** No, this is what you people require people to do. This is what you people require. Religion was also created by you people, as well as by your descendants.

**Question:** She wants to ask that all major religions require people to help others and selflessly contribute. However, there is also a book called "The Selfish Gene", which says that the survival, development and growth of human society are all due to selfish reasons. Selfishness is what enables human society to survive. Should we be selfless and contribute or should we have a certain degree of selfishness? How should we achieve a balance?
**Higher Spirit:**This world itself is balanced. It is you yourselves who are making it unbalanced. That is to say, the Creator created everything perfectly. It is you humans who are making it unbalanced. It's you yourselves who are making it unbalanced, and then allowing you to experience the imbalance. Even if you want to experience this imbalance, you are all permitted. Then, if you want to talk about selfishness, first you need to know that whether it's religion or books, they are all descriptions by each and every individual of their perception and cognition of this world, their understanding. Because each person has a unique perspective, there is no right or wrong here. You can also say that this world is because when you men and women see each other, there is desire. You can say that. If there were no desire, you would all have become extinct. No matter which argument, you can find something to support yours. Do you understand what I mean? So this is not about selfishness or unselfishness and dedication. First of all, you don't need to do it just because religion tells you to be a dedicated person and you do it grudgingly. Do you understand? You think, "I don't even have enough for myself, but I still have to offer." Do you think such an offering will bring a positive effect? Impossible. The most important thing is your consciousness, your state. That is what truly affects the outside world. For example, in the material world, many people are exhausted and have no energy to do anything else. But you think, "I still have to take care of my child and offer," but during the process of taking care, offering, or cooking, your heart is full of complaints and you are very reluctant. Your such emotions will all be in the food. When a child eats your food and doesn't feel love, he just feels: It seems like I shouldn't exist. Understand? I'm despised.

So, superficially pursuing anything is of no use; instead, it has a counter-effect. Only when you experience through substances yourself, for example, OK, I experienced selfishness, I experienced dedication. Then I finally found that when I dedicated, my heart was so joyful. When I was selfish, it turned out that I wasn't actually that happy. After you have experienced the two feelings, then next time you will automatically choose to dedicate, understand? 

It's of your own free will, not following anything. When you reach such a state, then your dedication can truly bring pleasure to others because you are joyful. So the key lies in an internal state and feeling within you.

**Question:**This netizen also wants to ask whether human destiny is predetermined by heaven.
**Higher Spirit:**Is human destiny predetermined? If we say that human destiny is predetermined, we can only say that the destiny is yours. Why? You chose this material world, your current lessons, what you want to experience, and what you want to break through because this is what you must face. You chose to come and break through this, you just forgot. So if it is predetermined, yes, it is predetermined by you. OK, I determined that I would come to experience a mental illness state, or I would experience being blind. Has that been predetermined? But for each of you, what is predetermined is harvest, which is a state of happiness, joy, and success. Why is this so? Because everything set for you is ultimately to enable you to get the gifts, which are the most desired and also the most needed by you.

**Question:**I understand. Then can we, for example, set that I want to experience A before reincarnation, and then after I enter the material world, do we have the right to modify? If so, to what extent?
**Higher Spirit:**Do we have the right to modify? For example, I initially chose to experience as a blind person, right? 
**Higher Spirit:**And then in the end I want to see, I don't want to be blind anymore. Then can you release this prop and change to a new set of clothes? 

**Question:**Does that mean we have to leave this material world and start over?
**Higher Spirit:**If the one you chose for yourself is very limited, yes. Your choice doesn't have to be so limited. That is, when you finish this experience, you can still continue to experience. But this requires you to be, so to speak, an awakened person, understand? That is, you know that it's not my physical body that is in control, but there is a higher existence. Then you will have a strong inner desire to do something. 

**Question:** Another netizen asks how to maintain a relatively good awareness while being in the world. In a relatively secluded environment, it is relatively easy to have a pure and undefiled state of mind. But after entering society, one will unconsciously be influenced by the collective consciousness, and it is difficult for you to remain clear-minded. (Interrupted) 
**Higher Spirit:** You came to this world precisely to allow you to fully engage. Because only after you are fully engaged can it bring you such a profound experience. This profound experience is the most important, understand?
So the profound experience is very important for you. The question he wants to ask is that he doesn't want to be blinded by the material world. But you need to experience the process of being blinded because after you wake up later, that is, after you are no longer blinded by the material world, you can utilize it, that is, use it positively, use your experience. Otherwise, it's as if, OK, the previous experiences and previous lessons are all weapons. If you don't get this weapon in your hand later, you have no weapon later. So you don't need to force yourself to reach any state unless you yourself are pursuing it in your mind.
If you have this pursuit, you are in this world, understand? It's also a pursuit of your mind. Your mind is pursuing something, say, pursuing tranquility. When your mind is pursuing certain things, actually you are still blinded by it, right? You still fall into illusion. So his question is how to have, that is, how to keep the mind calm. How can one achieve a calm mind? First of all, it's also a good experience when your mind is in chaos. Then how to achieve a calm mind is that only after you experience the chaos of your mind can you achieve a calm mind. Do you understand? This is a process for you to reach a calm mind. You also need to give up this process and don't pursue anything because all the gifts are in the present.

**Question:**This psychic girl wants to know that many psychics can see what will happen in the future. Then she wants to know how she can see the future. 
**Higher Spirit:** She wants to know how she can see the future. Do you know why she doesn't need to see the future? Because if she sees the future, this future is restricting her. Because some psychics who have low awareness can see. They think this is set. But when your consciousness reaches a certain level, you know, it's like a blank sheet of paper. You can draw whatever you want to draw instead of saying that a certain picture is like this or like this. Then she can see the future of others. She doesn't need to be psychic to see it. But the future she sees can also change. That is, as just said, what changes is not the future but your inner state. One thought leads to heaven, one thought leads to hell. The same situation, but you have a different state of mind. 

**Question:**This netizen wants to ask that Taiwan University's former president Li Siqin discovered a spiritual realm, that is, a world of consciousness where there is God, Guan Gong, Laozi, Kongzi, etc., which can only be seen by people with opened celestial eyes. She wants to know whether the spiritual realm he discovered is the same consciousness realm that one enters during lucid dreaming and out-of-body experiences. Is this spiritual realm an objectively existing real world, or is it just constructed by the collective consciousness of humanity? Or are some people real and some people constructed by the collective consciousness, such as Guan Gong? What are the differences between these two types of people in the spiritual realm?
**Higher Spirit:**For example, Guan Gong, isn't that a name given by you humans? When more people believe in him, it becomes true. So it doesn't matter what someone said or which one is true and which one is false. Even if not many people agree with a thing, even if only one person agrees with the world and a thing, that person can still have the corresponding experience. And again, for example, mental patients, right?


## 2021/07/10 - You are here to create, not to integrate.
**Higher Spirit:**You speak. What's the question? 
**Question:** What is my mission in this life?

**Higher Spirit:**What is your mission in this life? What's your name?
**Question:** XXX 
**Higher Spirit:**XXX, what is your mission in this life? Let me search first. The challenge you set for yourself is extremely huge. That is to say, the restraint of your challenge is like some people set for themselves as level one, and yours is level ten. Why do you need to set such a big challenge for yourself? Because you are an old soul, not a very young one. Because if you are young, when you think about the current world, if a child tries to lift a weight, a very light weight will be given to the child, right? Because he is a child. But if you are already a strongman, then you need to take on a very heavyweight for yourself to challenge. Because you won't touch those small weights or the ones for kindergarten kids or other children, right? Why? Because your level has reached that point. So you have chosen such a heavyweight challenge for yourself because you have evolved and developed to that level, the level of a strongman and the level of a child. Your weight experiences are different. Then the most important thing is that you are to experience the breakthrough that you make at the beginning. It will come from your family, from you as an individual, from your background, your environment. These are the breakthroughs you make and then you are facing the entire society, the country. Do you understand?

**Question:**What is the plan of my soul?
**Higher Spirit:**The plan of your soul is that, you need this continuous, layer by layer breakthrough and then breakthrough. Just like what I just said, it is first from a small scope to a large scope. These breakthroughs are not only in your individual but also will be reflected in the field and industry that you personally want to engage in. Because in the future, in your career and work, you will also face many that require you to break through and challenge. You will be an innovator and reformer. It's the path that no one has walked before. Would you take it?

**Question:**What do I need to break through?
**Higher Spirit:** What do you need to break through? It will appear step by step on every path of your life. So you don't need to know now what you will need to experience in the future. Because even if I tell you now, you won't have any understanding. It just comes to let you know that every step of yours will have something for you to break through. For example, what you need to break through now is your exams. This is also a breakthrough. What you need to face and break through now is some of your inner feelings and some of the thoughts in your heart. These are also for you to break through. Also, for example, if you haven't fully shown your own personality or your true emotions and feelings, this is also something you need to break through. So at every step there will be a breakthrough. It's not that there will be a breakthrough only when reaching a certain point.

**Question:**I have a gay friend. How should he integrate into this society?
**Higher Spirit:** How should your gay friend integrate into this society? You are not here to integrate into the original society. Your purpose is to constantly innovate, that is, you are constantly establishing the way a society should be for them to integrate. Do you understand what I mean? Because think about it, is your society always unchanged? Your society is constantly changing, constantly changing. Because there is no fixed, stable, or unchanging society here. Your country, your people, your society, and the thoughts of each of you are constantly changing all the time. So what you need to do is not to make these homosexuals integrate into the existing society because the existing society is constantly changing. Instead, it is about how you create an inclusive and diverse society. You create a society and then you live in it. You live in it.
So it's not that you have to adapt to the previous or old one because there is no previous or old one. It is constantly changing. It is always based on the thoughts and what each of you wants in your mind. For example, what kind of society do you want for yourself? Then you build it. Then you create it. This earth is yours. This society is yours. Everything is yours. You create it. And the older generation of people, that is to say, those with solidified thoughts or those with certain ideas or something. As their physical bodies disappear, these will gradually disappear too. Only if you yourself want to inherit their ideas and concepts, do you understand? For example, the concepts of the elderly. They have passed away, but you are still living within that concept. That means you actively bear one of their concepts and still live within it. What you need to break is not the deceased person, because the person has already died. What you need to break is within your mind. Why do you continue to hold onto others' concepts on yourself? So what you need to break through is yourself, not the external. Look at the old and many concepts in your society before. You continue to maintain them and actively take them onto yourself. Let it bind you and continue to experience. Why? Because the person who created the concept died long ago. Why do you still choose it and still experience it?
It's your own choice because you always have the choice to choose what you want to experience. However, these choices of yours will gradually affect your next generation. Because if your next generation continues to be like you and they don't break through. You continue to ask. Are there any other questions?

**Question:**No.

## 2021/08/15 - Everything is operating perfectly.
**Higher Spirit:** You say it. What's the problem?

**Question:**First, this psychic girl has two questions. Her first question is how to get rid of the desire for food.
**Higher Spirit:** How to get rid of the desire for food First of all, the most important thing in your material life is to take good care of your physical body. Taking care of this physical body includes its needs in terms of food and drink. But remember, you must not let this material body, that is, let it control everything. Do you understand what I mean? It's like you have an animal, you have a pet, and you are one with it, that is, you are in the same boat, like partners. You have to take good care of it and keep it in a normal and healthy state. But you must not let it completely control everything. Do you understand what I mean? Imagine if you have a hunting dog and you go hunting together, looking for prey, catching prey, and doing such things together. Then you have absolutely no ability to influence or control it at all, or you are completely controlled by this animal full of beastliness. How would you be? Do you understand what I mean? So all of this is related to your harmonious operation and balance. It's not about getting rid of desires. Think about it. If you have no such needs at all, if you have no interest in this food at all, then wouldn't your life have lost a lot of beauty? It should be about how to balance well between you and food because this relates to everything, not just food but also, for example, any, for example, medicine. If the right amount of medicine, it can save your life and help you. But if you take an excessive amount, it will kill you. That's all. Doctors tell you to control the dosage properly, right? 
你控制好量,它就是(没听清)你要控制不好…所以这个可以是任何,不只是⾷物也可以是酒精或者是药物或者是其它任何
就好像是你们⽣活中离不开的⽕你如果你能掌控它,⽕可以对你有很⼤的帮助如何你不掌控它… 还有⽔,任何都是这样所以应该是如何平衡好你跟⾷物的关系
⾼灵: 你还有问题吗
问: 有,这个通灵的⼥孩⼦第⼆个问题是如何把⾝体维持到瘦的状态
⾼灵: 如何把⾝体维持到瘦的状态 ⾸先,你们所说的瘦不是就是怎么说,就是要看你们⾃⼰的⼀个标准是什么因为对于有��⼈来说的瘦,他们是畸形的标准
They do not allow any fat to exist. The existence of fat is of great help and benefit to your body. It can even balance your mood. So everything is about balance. So if you don't want any fat at all, like a fitness athlete, this is also unbalanced. So if you are not a professional, like in bodybuilding or something, there is no need to harshly and blindly pursue extremes. Because any extremes will cause imbalance. The imbalance is not only from the aspect of health, but also from your spirit, your mood, and all aspects of you. So everything is not to be imbalanced.
If you don't deliberately pursue, for example, I blindly pursue being thin or I blindly pursue anything, you just allow your body to adjust itself to a healthy level and a balanced state. Then you don't have to worry or be concerned or anxious or have any such behavior. Your body will automatically adjust to a suitable state for you because your body is very wise. Because many people, for example, eating a lot, a very, very lot in terms of diet, is actually a kind of anxiety or a mental imbalance for them, causing them to eat too much. If they don't have a certain kind of anxiety or stress or any compulsive behavior mentally, their body won't consume too much food either. So when you just let go, be relaxed, and not be in an extreme state of worrying or fearing or being anxious like this, your body will also remain in such a state. This is to enable you to remain in a healthy and balanced state, rather than deliberately pursuing some extreme.

**Question:**May I ask another question?
**Higher Spirit:** You say. 
**Question:**My next question is that in my current state at present, do my guiding spirit and my Higher Self have any information they want to convey to me?
**Higher Spirit:** Does your Higher Self have any information it wants to convey to you? I'll link your current information. Or is it that you need to trust, let go and trust life because you still think you will need to use your material mind, as if to study or research or plan in this regard to make your life or situation develop in which direction, or force it to develop in which direction? In fact, it's not like that. Because currently, both you and this psychic girl, you two feel as if there is a kind of waste of time, that is, a state of not doing truly meaningful things. Because, for example, you two have the same hobby, that is, a strong interest in some of these spiritual aspects, like what we are doing currently, but you haven't spent much time on it. Then you will feel as if you are not on the path that you want or the one you are passionate or enthusiastic about. You both will have such a feeling. So deep in your hearts, you always feel as if something is missing. But you should know that true spirituality is not that only when you are linked with us, when we are in contact and communicating like this, this state is spirituality. It's not. Rather, it is a spiritual presence in every moment of your life because the way it expresses itself is not limited to just this way. It expresses in any way. For example, when you like painting and you really calm down to create a piece, you are actually in spiritual communication and connection. Do you understand what I mean? So in any situation, for example, when you are with a stranger and you give a friendly look to the stranger, and that look really touches him. Why? Because in your mind, you have no personal judgment of him, or your fear, or anything of your physical body. For instance, your experiences with black people, such as what black people have brought to you in your life, these experiences all belong to your physical body. If you can cast aside all of these, the remnants within your physical body. You merely offer him (unclear) or give him a smile. Then you are being psychic. Why? Because you enable him to perceive the light and love from your eyes and your smile. Do you comprehend my meaning? When there are still remnants of the physical body within you, that is, when you make contact with him and have in your mind: The impression I had from interacting with blacks before was this. Then you are entering the physical body. In such a case, you are being influenced by the material world.
If you are being influenced by the material world, then you will not bring others that sort of shock or spiritual touch or warmth or the sensation of love. Do you understand? So everywhere you are, at every moment, you can create this feeling for others starting from yourself. When you look at your own body, you don't judge it, and you don't dislike it anymore. Do you understand what I mean? When you are full of dislike for it, do you understand? That sense of dislike of yours will force you to do certain things anxiously. It may be from food, or it may be from other aspects, various aspects. So you can treat yourself in this way first. You can look at your body, yourself, and everything with unconditional love. When you can treat yourself with such an attitude, you will have such an attitude towards others. Otherwise, when you look at others, your words are also full of something like a benchmark or a ruler. You are comparing and judging. Because we have been telling you through spiritual communication not to define (with a strong tone) anyone, nor to define (with a strong tone) yourself. Because the moment you define, it has undergone countless changes. Because all changes occur in an instant, not in one day, two days, three days, or four days. It's not that this won't happen. It's in the very moment. Suddenly, it's as if you understand everything that happens in the world and you recall everything. In that moment, even if a person just killed someone a second ago, the moment he puts down the knife, he suddenly realizes that he actually has no hatred in his heart. His hatred is love. Why? Because he loves this person and feels that this person didn't act in the way he loves for a certain thing. It's more of a disappointment. Do you understand? That disappointment contains love. So when he suddenly realizes that the emotion he has is not true hatred, he becomes a different person, immediately.
Broken line. JOJO's retelling of the broken line part: After he killed someone, he realized that he didn't hate that person at all. In fact, he deeply loves that person because that person did something that disappointed him. Then he understood what love is. After that, he has understood what love is. And you still don't understand what love is. How can you judge him as a murderer? This is what he (Higher Spirit) has to explain. That is to say, you don't even know what love is. For example, love is a butterfly. You have never even known what a butterfly is and haven't seen one. Then he (the murderer) is someone who has seen a butterfly. How can you judge him? So he (Higher Spirit) asks us not to judge anyone, even a murderer, and not to say that he is a sinner or something.
**Higher Spirit:** You ask again: I want to know if you can give me now, because I want to focus on the job I like. Can you give me some guidance and information in this regard?
**Higher Spirit:** Just said earlier, that is to say, you still think that all events occur because your mind studies, delves into, and forces them to occur. Because when you enter such a state, you will continuously experience such a state, continuously still looking, still looking, still seeking, still considering, still researching. Do you understand what I mean? You only need to let go of any, that is, how the "focus" issue in your mind. Because as I just told you, in every moment you can do the things you are passionate about. For example, every moment, every present, you can make it, as if it's training your body, that is training your, just like I just said, you need to remove some memories and judgments of your physical body. Because as I just told you, how important judgments are, that is, why can't you judge anyone? Even if he is a murderer, you think about a murderer. You can't judge him easily.
Don't mention others, right? So you have to let go of all definitions and judgments, including about yourself, your current situation, and everything you are experiencing at present. Because you are all ignorant people. And if you were informed, if you knew everything, you would think everything is perfect and you wouldn't want to interfere with it, understand?

**Question:**Because I have a question in my mind now. For example, when I see Dr. Joe or something, as long as it is at this moment, completely enter this moment, link to the energy field of the ether, we can create matter from that energy field. Then I am now by this idea all the time. How to say it? That is, I think I need to do this. Then doing so will help me focus. I just can't get rid of this thought.
**Higher Spirit:**You don't know how to get rid of the thoughts in your mind. Just now we said that if when you meet a person, in your mind, it's completely your own memories, your thoughts, your judgments, any of your voices, then you are not seeing that person. If you can't see the true something of that person, then you are missing everything. It's like that person themselves came into your life to bring you a gift or offer you a very good job or something, but you can't see. You have entered a world created in your own mind.

**Question:**Then should I, for example, like what people in the material world say, sleeping is just sleeping, eating is just eating When I'm doing something, don't have in my mind the thought of, and place myself in the present moment. Would it be helpful for me? Not living so much in my mind.

**Higher Spirit:**You need to understand that the truly, truly, truly most meaningful thing for you is that in the present moment. The most meaningful thing for you is how you don't miss the present moment, how you don't wrongly define the present moment, and how you don't block the present moment. Because many people are in the present moment but they are in a state of blocking it. So when you can completely not be like this, just as I just said that your physical body is actually a hunting dog, it's your partner, it's your collaborator, it's your partner. Do you understand? It only does part of the work, but if you give all the work to it. So you need to know when it makes a move, when you make a move, and when together

**Question:**I still have one question. It's that now it's not about getting this COVID-19 vaccine. Then I saw a lot of conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 vaccine and many spiritual mentors and some so-called psychics, that is, people who can communicate with lives outside the Earth, all said that this vaccine should not be taken. After taking it, it will reduce the connection between your physical body and your complex, your spirit body. I know that what everyone said is true, but when I think of this, I always feel that this problem bothers me, that is, I haven't completely thrown what they said behind my mind.
**Higher Spirit:**So your question is that you want to know whether the vaccine has any impact on you. Let alone the vaccine, any virus will not have any impact on you. As long as you don't go for it, the impact it can have on you is like, how to put it, you yourself have a bomb, and it's the fuse. So because of your body, even if this vaccine has an effect on you, you should know that your body is constantly, constantly renewing. Do you understand what I mean? You are always a new you. So whether it's the effect of the vaccine, or the effect of the medicine, or other truly some in nature, these viruses' impact on you will all be constantly updated by your body all the time. Let's put it this way. Imagine your body is a glass of water, and your glass of water is constantly being infused with new water, and there is also constantly water going out. Then the external viruses, that is dirty water. Dirty water gets in, but you constantly have fresh water coming in. Then you keep having water discharged. After a while, won't all your water be replaced completely? So it's the same with your body. So you have to trust your body. You just trust it. You don't have to listen to anyone because many people have a lot of fears. Those fears only work for them and only have an impact on them. You just don't join them.


**Question:**I have a question. When I am meditating, that is, when I am entering the state, I haven't felt that energy coming to me during this period. But I found that, for example, when I was going to experience some material events that had a relatively large impact on me, I would always receive this dream a few days before. Then I found that the things I experienced matched this dream. Is it a kind of psychic way for me? Also, why can't I sense that energy recently?
**Higher Spirit:**You can't sense that energy recently. Do you want to continuously sense the same energy? It's like in your life, in all your experiences, you can't fully experience the same thing. Do you understand what I mean? Because even if it's the same lover, do you think you are with the same lover? No. Actually, at every moment, you are a new lover. What that lover will become also depends on your state, your (unclear) state. Do you think you are interacting with the same you? Your that you is also constantly changing. You can review your own life. So, any and all, pursuing the same feeling is in your minds, understand? For example, the mind gets some kind of stimulus, and after that stimulus brings it pleasure, it will always pursue it. Just like a dog that finds something delicious in a certain place and will often run there. This is a certain something of your physical body. But what you need to know is that you can never experience the same thing, person, or object exactly the same. Do you think so? It's the same. It's just an illusion. It's just an illusion. So always, every present moment, every instant is new. This is why I tell you why you shouldn't define yourself or others. Why? Because every present moment is new. 
**Question:**Well, if we have complete trust in ourselves, can we break free from something like Yin-Yang and the Five Elements, meaning this kind of thing won't have an impact on us? Because often I see some articles.
**Higher Spirit:**Do you think that saying a word that it has an impact on you, whether breaking free from its impact, you've already been influenced by it. You've already been influenced by it. Why do you think that? When you want to do something or you want to avoid something, you've already entered it, understand? So when you are resisting, or hiding, or running away, or refusing something, you are actually entering it. Because, for example, those foreigners, they have no concept of Yin-Yang and the Five Elements at all. Do you think they would think about how to escape its influence? For instance, children don't have these concepts either. So when you are thinking about how to escape it, you are already under its control and you have already entered it.

**Question:**Then this psychic girl wants to know if her Higher Self and guiding spirits have any messages for her regarding her current state, this point.
**Higher Spirit:** I'll link all the information today and she will benefit from it. One point is just like what I just said. All of you have a very great interest, enthusiasm, passion, and love for spirituality. You all want to have more actions in this aspect and think that if you haven't entered this aspect currently, you are wasting your life or time. But this information has told you that it's not that only through this way are you psychic, understand? When you all become love completely, that is, when there is no fear, judgment or anything in your mind, and when you are not affected by your physical body, you are psychic. Why? Because you are just love, pure love. You are just a stream of love energy. This stream of energy melts everything. Why do you have, as if there is a kind of yearning or addictive behavior towards this energy, constantly wanting to experience it? Because what you experience is completely without any troubles, without any, only the energy of complete love, making you constantly want to experience it. However, what I tell you is that you can have this energy at any time. It's not that you have to enter such a state to become this energy. You can have it at any time. You don't wait for others to create this kind of energy for you, but you yourselves also become that kind of energy and let others experience it. Then, at any time, you can practice in every moment, every instant of your life. It's not that it needs to be specific or designated in a certain way. Then this information is very helpful for both you and her because when you become more and more connected, that is, the energy of infinite love, you will spend a lot of time in such a state. If you spend a lot of time in such a state, you will naturally let many people see this unconditional love from you.
So today's information is like water. You seem to be the land. You are nourished by the rain. Everything in your land will be nourished. Everything will be nourished in any way. 所以它⼀定会就是发芽、开花、结果所有的信息都是爱的滋养所以这些信息对她来说都会有很多的帮助如果再问⼀下有没有什么特别的信息给她的话,就是说去热爱你的⽣命,热爱你⽣命中发⽣的每⼀件事情,热爱你⽣命中的每⼀天,每⼀个⽚刻不要去抗拒任何
问: 我想问⼀下我脉轮的情况
⾼灵: 你要知道刚刚像我说的,你不要给你有任何任何的定义如果我现在告诉你,你的脉轮是堵塞的和你现在的脉轮是通的,有什么变化吗 因为当我在说这⼀分钟,你也可以马上转换到另外⼀个状态明⽩我意思吗
It's like this person. As I just said, just killed a person. Just killed a person a second ago. You ask me whether this person is good or bad. When I was about to say he was bad because he killed a person, the moment he put down the knife, he had realized what true love is and he became a saint. How can you ask me to say whether he is a sinner or a saint? So, as I said just now, at every moment of yours, you can become the kind of state that is connected to love, that is, become the kind of state of letting go of your material mind. If you are basically in such a state, then your entire person is unobstructed, do you understand? But material experiences are also very important for you. You don't need to just pursue reaching that state. Because when you are pursuing, you are missing your current lessons. So some pain, experiencing some psychological entanglements or confusion, or anger, is also very good. Because only your material mind will blindly pursue something that makes you feel good, do you understand? So you, when you, I tell you that state is the best. If you blindly pursue it, you enter it again. Do you understand what I mean?


**Question:**I would like to ask about my question of preparing materials to change the residence card. 
**Higher Spirit:** You mean the information of your materials. What do I want to give you? The information I want to give you here is that no matter what happens, no matter what environment you are in, you can enjoy it. You can fully enjoy your life. 
Rather than being limited to specifying that a certain thing must happen this way, or that it must happen this way for you to enjoy life, do you understand?


## 2021/08/24 - Marriage and Gender Relations
**Higher Spirit:**You ask. **Question:** In a marital relationship or in a gender relationship, if the other party doesn't satisfy oneself, oneself will feel unhappy or dislike the other party. So I want to ask, why in a relationship do we all want the other party to operate according to our own pattern?
**Higher Spirit:**I'll repeat your question. You want to know that in marriage or in other relationships, if the other party doesn't operate in the way you want, then you will have emotions. Regarding this, this is for you all, basically for people in your material world, a very big obstacle and lesson.
Then this is what you call 'e', and then you have 'attachment' and'me'. Why do many of our psychic messages say that in our last psychic session, it was said that you should let go of yours, that is, when you meet someone, you should let go of any memory, any concept, any information stored about him. You should let go because only in this way can you truly not only meet the real other person but also help him meet the real him because he may not have even seen the real him himself.
When you are immersed in your own set, you, your memory, your concept, your idea, everything you have inside, that is an obstacle for you to know him and an obstacle for you to know yourself. This is a very big obstacle, whether in your self-awareness or in your relationship, it is a very big obstacle. So through this, you can have a deeper understanding or realization of exactly how much influence those definitions, insights, concepts, memories, and thoughts in your material mind have on you when you are moving, exercising, operating, or analyzing. When it is generating activities... Let me tell you how your psychic abilities occur now. Psychic abilities occur when she now, in her mind, has no personal memories, personal insights, personal thoughts, or thinking. She turns those off. Now this voice comes out. This is what you call wisdom. This is what you call inspiration or connection, connecting to your Higher Self. You can call it anything. If you think that when you are communicating with the spirit now and her thoughts and concepts are still active, this information can't come in. So, it's not that this information requires you to study, to search for, to recite or to remember. It's just like a well. It's not that you have to lead water to it or find water for it. It's to remove the blocked part and the water will come out. So it's inherently connected. Just think about it, each of you is like a well, and all the wells are connected to the source. Then you just need to remove the blockage and make it unobstructed, and then you can get it. So when you have these conscious activities of the material mind existing, it's not just for you, that is to say, an insight in life, or wisdom or whatever, it will also have a certain impact on your relationship and other aspects of you. But these impacts are all good. Why? You can start from any point. For example, your problem. Its symptoms are manifested through your marital relationship. Well, then you can start from the marital relationship and then step by step, it's like, follow the vine to find the melon. Do you understand what I mean? Then you will discover wisdom and you will grow. There is a saying that troubles give birth to wisdom, that is, troubles are Bodhi, and so on. That is to say, anything that causes you troubles, you can follow it and then step by step find the source and link to the source. Then this is the meaning of your life. That is to say, through these difficulties, troubles, pains, and setbacks that you manifest in life, then you explore yourself and find a way out. So we come back to your previous question. Ask it again.

**Question:**Why in a relationship, if the other party doesn't satisfy oneself, oneself will be unhappy or dislike the other party? Why in a relationship do we all want the other party to operate according to our own mode?
**Higher Spirit:** Yes, that is what you call the 'ego'. Because even if it's not the other party, even if you call the 'other party' just 'fate', if fate doesn't follow what's in your mind, for example, you want to get promoted and get rich, you want to become a beautiful woman or a handsome man, you want to have a certain amount of wealth, or any other thing Fate doesn't operate in the way you want, and then you start to hate life or think that life is meaningless. Also, there are many such situations in relationships. That's because you still think of yourself as one, that is, you identify yourself with your physical body and your material mind. You too much agree with your material mind. But for this girl, it's her problem. Then I want to say that actually she doesn't. She just looks at the emotions of her body, but she doesn't get trapped. Because she has one, it's like there is a bystander. She observes the emotions she generates herself. She doesn't try to control or change, or how to change the other party. Because if you were still stubborn and unrepentant, you wouldn't have this communication. Do you understand? Because they would have quarrels instead of communicating with me here and with you. That means she has realized that the emotion she brought out was from her material mind, not from the other party. As we said in the previous psychic message, it's not to make your life always happy and without troubles. But when you have troubles or are in the fog, you know how to get out, do you understand? When you know how to get out, you are not trapped at all and you are free. So, from the current perspective of self-awareness, to that extent, she is no longer in the game. Because when you are in the game, it's impossible for you to have such problems. You might think it's about meeting the wrong person, or 'Oh, his habits', or you still think whether it would be better to change someone, or whether a quarrel would be fine. You still want to change the situation externally. But this communication of yours is looking inward. When you have this awareness, actually, you have come out, understand? So you are already in a quite清醒 state, not like people in a dream. Because if a person is really in a dream, they don't know they are dreaming. If you come now and tell, 'How about my dream, how about it', that means you already know you are dreaming. Also, in fact, you already know the answer. You just ask how, when the other party doesn't meet what I want, how, when you have dissatisfaction, how to let it go. 你说如何放下什么
问: 就是如何放下控制或者是期待 然后怎么样才能在这样的,就是当对⽅和我在关系中有不同的需求的时候,我们如何才能更好的和谐相处
⾼灵: 控制和期待你的控制和期待,你是在⽆意识当中运⾏的,明⽩吗 就⽐如说,你去打也好,去骂也好,去任何争吵也好,你还是在控制当中你在控制当中如何放下它 你能明⽩这些如果已经是,这个不是来对对⽅,是来对于你⾃⼰的⼀个,就是你能明⽩你产⽣的这些情绪,其实你已经放下了,明⽩吗 你不需要去,就是你能领悟这个是产⽣于你,你已经就⾛出来了
You have already walked out of it because of those subsequent emotions. This is only for those who don't understand. They will continue to be in this generated emotion. They will continue to be in this emotion and want to forcefully change or change the other party. That is, if you have understood, you have already let it go.
Just like when you are in the dark, when the light has come in, the darkness no longer exists and you don't need to say how I drive away the darkness. You keep asking.

**Question:**In our marital relationship, for example, he wants to play games and I want him to have dinner with me. When there is such a mutual disagreement or disharmony, how can we get along more harmoniously? Can this question be mentioned separately or has it been summarized earlier?

**Higher Spirit:** The first thing you need to understand is: There is no one else outside. The only one you need to get along with harmoniously is yourself. It's yourself. It's the relationship between you and yourself, and your own material mind. Think about it. If your material mind doesn't generate that kind of thought like, why doesn't he accompany me? Why is he like this? Why is it like that? If it doesn't generate this kind of thought, concept, or emotion at all, do you understand what I mean? If it doesn't generate anything, then would there be subsequent feelings of dissatisfaction like, why doesn't he accompany me? No. So, the only one you need to get along with harmoniously is you and your body, that is, your material mind and its operating mode, rather than the other person. Because your material mind will generate based on some activities and consciousness of the other person.
It's like, okay, the other person is moving. He doesn't look at me. He is by himself... Then you start to have judgmental voices. You start to look for. He is always playing games. You see, he played yesterday, he is playing today, and he plays every day.
Just start to remember and start to act.
Those resentments in the heart before start to surface. Do you understand what I mean? If you observe your mind consciousness, that is, how it operates. If you do, that is, carefully, meticulously, that is, very sensitively to catch any mental activity of yours, any thought you have, any sound you produce. Observe it, and you will find that your mind has been judging, has been defining, has been chattering non-stop. We told you before, don't define anything. Don't define anyone. Don't define yourself. Don't define anything because everything, everything is constantly changing. Because when you define, actually you are reinforcing. You are reinforcing that you are still projecting it. That is, you are creating it. For example, when you yourself say: "He is always playing games," it's in your own mind. It's the voice in your own mind.

Then, this of yours will keep projecting the same state all the time. Because we have been communicating with you psychically and teaching you a concept that is, any of your states of tranquility, your emotions, anything of yours, it's not because of how external substances are and how you are. Do you understand what I mean? It's not that you really have a perfect object because there is never a perfect object. Because even you yourself (aren't perfect), understand? So there will never be a completely perfect one here. Let's just say, even if you are given a robot and everything is designed according to the mode you want and you set it up, one day you will die in the mode you set yourself. Understand what I mean? You will find that many modes you will no longer like later. You will only discover these modes, and it is also those modes that kill you.
It is also those modes that you hate, and it is also those modes that you don't like. So you don't need to get along harmoniously with any one person. The only one you need to get along harmoniously with is your material mind and prevent it from playing what you don't like. Let's refrain from assigning negative connotations to things, as our definitions shape our reactions and experiences. Everything that happens and exists externally is neutral; let's give it all positive definitions.


**Question:**I am still in a relationship with that boy. He has returned to me, and I sense that his affection for me is growing. I find myself relying on him emotionally, but I'm aware that we won't end up together. I'm seeking advice on how to maintain a joyful relationship and ensure that neither of us gets hurt when it eventually comes to an end. Sometimes I feel as though I'm deceiving him, yet his absence does cause me distress. Could you offer some guidance on how to navigate this situation?
**Higher Spirit:** You guys, first of all, you need to know exactly what it is about this relationship that you can't do without. What exactly does this relationship bring to you? That is, it makes you feel that your sense of existence is lost because you leave the relationship. You don't know that you exist. So, do you want to feel that you are cared for, or protected, or important, or loved through this relationship? Or do you think you are very lonely, very lonesome, and need a companion, or someone to talk to? If you only use this relationship to meet some of your needs, then you must, just like I just said, you must have a very sensitive, that is, sensitive, to observe these emotions and feelings that you generate yourself, and then you figure it out little by little. 
Because knowing yourself is a process. It's not a matter of one or two days, nor through one or two events. You need to spend your entire life to know yourself.
So for these emotions regarding this matter, because you don't need to, currently don't need to define yourself or your relationship. You just observe the emotions that arise in your relationship with him. OK, you have a sentence: "I can't live without him." If you can't, then continue to ask yourself what exactly you can't live without him. Can't live without his daily greetings. Can't live without having someone to accompany you and pass your boring time every day. Step by step, ask yourself exactly what you can't live without. So in this way, you can gradually know yourself and discover that you are so afraid of being alone and that you think you are so unimportant because you need others to confirm your importance.
Originally, you are so afraid to face yourself. Originally, your life is so boring. You can through step by step by step by step. All relationships are like mirrors. All relationships are like mirrors. It is to let you see yourself clearly.
This is the purpose of the existence of the relationship, to help you know yourself, and you are also helping the other party know themselves. Why are you all very happy and happy when you are in love? Why? Because you think in this relationship, you are so perfect, you are so beautiful, you are so important, you are so unique. Because you enjoy this unique feeling, special feeling, the feeling of being valued, the feeling of being noticed, the feeling of being praised, the feeling of being needed. It fulfills all of these for you. So all the relationships can bring you to a state of self-awareness, self-understanding, self-perception, and also an exploration of life, a cognition of life. Because you will generate many emotions through relationships, and these emotions are all these. Just like the vine and the melon I mentioned earlier, the melon is your gift. Do you have any more questions about this?

**Question:**I'm done with this question. I have another one. That is, the guiding spirit who asked me to reach a connection with him through writing, does he have anything he wants to say to me? Does he have any information he wants to bring to me?
**Higher Spirit:** You want to ask if the being who asked you to connect through writing has anything he wants to bring to you. His message is that right now it seems like you are collecting information, looking for materials, and no matter all the negative and positive emotions and feelings that come to you in your life, all of these will, and would be, precious information and materials for you in the future. It's as if you are going to create a work of art, build a palace or a house. So now you are constantly walking on the path, picking up this stone, picking up this branch. You keep picking up these and you can all utilize them to decorate your house. So, there is a saying among you that art comes from life. Therefore, in life, you should not think that you are either idling away your time now, or wasting it, or squandering it. What you need is to throw yourself out completely, let go, and don't have any definitions in your mind. Ah, it seems that this matter is different from what I imagined, or it's not the path I truly should take. Because you don't know what path you should take, so you just need to let go and experience. If you think getting yourself dead drunk allows you to experience thorough pain and thorough love, then do it. Everything is an experience, and you can apply all these experiences in your works just like cooking. Experience to your heart's content. The purpose of your coming to the material world is to experience to your heart's content. Why? Because you have a body that enables you to experience to your heart's content. You will feel pain, and you will have all kinds of feelings, warm feelings, sad, sorrowful, and lonely, these profound experiences.
**Higher Spirit:**Then there is another piece of information that I want to bring to this psychic girl. Recently, you experienced that someone came to your house and messed up your home, do you understand? Although it was a thief who stole your things and messed everything up, do you understand what I mean? When he was breaking all these rules, in fact, he was leading you to a safer path. So don't be afraid to disrupt everything. Just like today when your child messed up your books and you got angry and hit him. Then you seemed to have a fear of disrupting things. Think about it. If you, together with your child, used those messed-up books to build a house and made him happy during the process, then you wouldn't be so nervous. Learn to create from a bunch of disrupted things after they have been destroyed. It's just that all this disruption is not really a disruption. Instead, it's leading to a more creative, productive, and meaningful path. So the superficial damage won't destroy anything. You only need to worry that the external damage will destroy. Because the true order and the true law are held within you, not relying on or dependent on the outside. Do you understand what I mean? The same goes for your marital relationship. It's not that you have to sit and eat every day, then talk about some topics, and then it seems that you are so perfect. Do you understand what I mean? Your relationship is so perfect and so orderly, but in reality, you are just following a dead procedure instead of a living thing. What you need is something alive, because love is always alive. Love is not dead. It's not like those believers in the churches. You follow these rules and you're a noble person, you're an angel of God or something. It's alive. It doesn't care about how it presents or behaves externally. So don't be afraid to disrupt, don't be afraid to be destroyed. You just need to use your creative and alive heart of love to lead everything, everything, everything, everything to the path of love. Because only the path of love is the right way, it's the true order. All the others are not. Do you understand? If you always, always love each other like this, have passion for each other, do you care whether you eat at the table today or on the ground? Do you understand? You don't care at all. So this information of yours will be a very big improvement for her. Then you saw again through this that, on the surface, they had an unpleasant lunch, but this unpleasant lunch brought a leap-like breakthrough in her spirituality. Imagine that. So, is this disruption a positive disruption? Did they serve you through the positive aspect again? This information can not only help you, but many others. Imagine that. So, don't be frightened by some current scenes or illusions. You think, wow, we didn't seem to have that this time. How could it be like this? Will the relationship get worse in the future? Don't have any thoughts like this. Only when you worry that it will get bad or worse will you prevent it. If you don't have such concerns at all, and you just want to create. Create happiness in every present moment, enjoy life without being restricted by anything


## 2021/08/30 - About Exorcism
**Higher Spirit:** You ask. What's the question?

**Question:**This girl wants to know why she has such a strong feeling about this ancient Bible she bought today.
**Higher Spirit:** I'll link her now to understand why she has such a strong feeling about the book she's holding. I'll search for information. I need to put her in a stable linking state now. This process is like when you're tuning a radio. She'll slowly stabilize the signal and keep the frequency in a linked state, and then all the information will come in. She wants to know why she has such a strong feeling about this book. Why? Because she has a very strong feeling for many things that have a history, like what you call antiques. Because these items store a lot of energy. For example, an old house or an old, that is, an old tree that stores a lot of (energy), or like this book she said. Because these items are like an old person, like a person several hundred years old. Just think about it.
Anyone of you would be interested in a person several hundred years old. Why? Because he stores a lot and a lot of information and a lot and a lot of energy. And in the process of the release of those energies, there is unlimited information. So it's not because it's a Bible. The Bible has no special meaning. Even if it's another book... If it has such energy... So what attracts her is that energy, not that it's a Bible or a certain book. If it turns into another item, she will also be equally interested because this energy will bring her in, just like a door. Imagine that there is a room with a door. Behind that door are all kinds of things. You really want to go in and explore. So this item is also like opening a door for her to go in and explore. So even if a person who is one or two hundred years old sits in front of her, she will also be very interested in him. It's for this reason. Do you have any other questions?

**Question:**I would like to ask if there is any information that this book wants to convey to her.
**Higher Spirit:** Is there any information that this book wants to convey to her. Just now I said that this book is like opening a door for you. And inside that door, there are all kinds of... Then you can explore this information. It's like there are countless contents in this book. The countless contents are like a treasure chest. It's like a box with all kinds of things for you to explore. You can even flip through any page, open any chapter, and you can extract information from it. These are like mirrors. It doesn't mean, for example, that for the same information, when this girl reads it, when her husband reads it, and when her friend reads it, they get completely different things. So the important thing is not the information itself, but that you extract it, you read it, you understand it, and what you get from it. So it will be for different people. That is, for different people, you will get different things.
You **Question:** May I ask, is exorcism with the Bible real?
**Higher Spirit:**You mean the kind of exorcism with a book that you see on TV. That is, this book can bring him that kind of power. Only if you don't have this faith, that is, you don't believe in the Bible. You don't have this concept. You don't have this belief. You don't have this faith. You also don't firmly believe that the Bible has powerful energy. You also don't know that the Bible has energy. Then it has no effect at all, understand? So only if you firmly believe. OK. This book of yours has powerful energy. You have to use this energy and then drive away the demon of the other party. But actually, what really drives away the demon is your intention. That is, you firmly believe that this thing will happen and then it creates this result that has been driven away in your world. 
Again, that is to say, the other party also joins your reality. He joins you. Why? He sees you as so vivid, that is, he sees your performance as so vivid. Do you understand what I mean?
He also enters your illusion and he believes it. Then the two of you successfully and jointly create a result. That is to say, only if you believe, you believe one hundred percent and then he joins you and then you
can succeed in exorcising demons. If anything, that is, if you don't believe the book has this energy, and you also don't believe that you can succeed in exorcising demons, or if he doesn't believe you, none of this will hold. Because, for example, some people, he doesn't believe the first time, the second or third time, he sees you so vividly, and he believes it too. So, it is created like this, rather than that the book really has any, that is, this book seems like a tool, it depends on whose hands it is used in.
It might be nothing in someone else's hands, but in yours, it turns into a magical miracle. Some people, for example, are completely indifferent to energy. When he sees such a shabby book, he thinks it's garbage.

**Question:** I want to ask about that thing of using writing to link to his guiding spirit because I haven't successfully linked to it yet, so I want to ask what else I need to do better or improve?
**Higher Spirit:**First of all, you need to be clear about what you want to do. You can use your imagination first. You can start first, just like I just said in the process of your exorcism, you must even deceive yourself. Even you yourself are completely immersed in it. So if you really want to write, you have to look at yourself. If you are genuine, not that you think you got some information before and just do as they told you. Instead, you really want to create a work, want to express, and then you immerse yourself in it. Just try, as if you are looking for something. You may have no clue at the beginning. Slowly, slowly, you find a little clue. Slowly, slowly, there are more and more clues. Slowly, slowly, all are the thing you are looking for. Isn't it the same when you make money in the material world? You may not know how to make money at the beginning, then start to taste a little sweetness, and then more and more, more and more, like a snowball.
This is all of you, all of the experiences in the material world. It's yours. It's that you believe, and then your belief creates again, and then doubles... That is, the more you believe that you can make money easily, the easier the money comes.

**Question:** May I ask that I have been particularly interested in the channeling message of an American psychic channeler, Abraham Hicks, recently. Her channeling message can help me better understand our psychic channeling. I want to know why I like her message so much. Is there any special significance?
**Higher Spirit:**Because you yourself are also a disseminator. You yourself are also a disseminator. It's like you have found your kindred spirit. So, you will be like you, that is, the same or similar to you. Just like some people who are extremely fond of magic, they will be interested in all magicians. Some people are particularly fond of singing, and then they will also be interested in those... some paintings Then you like to have contact with, that is, those in other dimensions, which you can't see, and you are also entering this door and walking in this direction as if I just said at the beginning. You had a clue at the beginning and were searching, gradually more and more, more and more. So you will pay attention to a series of people of this type.
**Higher Spirit:**Then this girl also wants to know some information about the owner who once owned this book. This owner was once a very kind, very kind old man. And when he owned this book, he was already in his old age. And when he got this book, it was already, that is, this was not new. It has passed through many hands and then landed in his hands. Then this kind old man, his personality is very quiet and he has many, many people that he loves silently in his heart because his personality is not the kind that is vigorous, explosive or intense. Because his personality is rather introverted, quiet and shy, just like the water in a small stream rather than the water in a big river, that kind of feeling. So his energy is very calm, very calm. And he often opens the book in the dead of night, that is, turns a page. Then this book can bring him to a deeper state. So he often flips through this book. And the message he wants to bring to this woman is that I hope the tranquility, the kind of peaceful, the kind of harmony, that kind of feeling that this book brings to me can be brought to you as well. Then it's about wanting her to know that all of you, all of you, all of you are connected. It's like although it seems we are separated by a century, but in fact, we are all, as if there is a line linking us together. So he said he could still be like an old man, and in front of you, in front of her, tell her stories. Although for her, she is interested in all ancient things. So for her, this old man is already very old, and then he can also tell her stories as long as you, that is to say, are interested and you still have the opportunity to really, as if communicating with him face to face, to feel his energy, to feel his personal story, to feel his joys and sorrows. Because he was particularly lonely in his old age before and had no one to confide in, nor any listeners, nor anyone to listen to him share. But he is very willing to share his insights on life with you if you are willing to listen. Because his character is such that it's not coercive. If you don't like it, then he won't do it. Only when you especially wish for it, then he will join.
Do you have any more questions?

**Question:**May I ask if there is anything else that my Higher Self, my guiding spirit or any other beings want to bring me the message?
**Higher Spirit:** The special message for you is to hope that you can have more such exchanges because such exchanges not only nourish you but also seem to nourish many more. For example, the two of you are like a well.You allow the water to gush out from this well. After that, you yourselves are a living well instead of a dry well, right? Then more and more thirsty people will come here to draw water, and the number of people drawing water will keep increasing. So I hope you can keep this well from drying up in this way. This is the message for you because there are many thirsty people. They hope... They have been looking for water sources but haven't found them yet. And you are like light. If you don't go out, they will eventually find you. So you need to continuously emit your light for those in the darkness so that they can find the bright spots.


## 2021/09/05 - What is the right partner?

**Higher Spirit:** Go ahead and speak. Your question. 
**Higher Spirit:** You clearly want to be good to others... Because people in your material world are all using their minds to judge, that is, to evaluate, to determine, to calculate, and to measure all your things. When you are using your mind... So you will use your mind continuously, as if you are forcing yourself to do one thing. Just think about it like this. You yourself are your child and you found a particularly good partner for him or her. Then you are very satisfied with this partner and you want to force him or her to maintain this relationship well. Do you understand? You say that this relationship can take care of you, can make you happy for a lifetime and can ensure you have no worries about food and clothing, and can make you not have to worry. Can make you like this and that. He or she has told you a lot. That is to say, your mind has affirmed that this relationship will bring you benefits... It has affirmed that it will bring you benefits. Then your mind, what is your brain used for? It is to evaluate everything and then seize everything that is beneficial to you. You will only make choices that are beneficial to you. For example, a moldy apple and a good apple. You will definitely take the good apple, right? Because this is the mode your mind operates. You will seize everything that is beneficial to you. So this is why the conflict you have now is the conflict of your mind. Also, your physical body, your mind has no idea at all about what theme your soul chose for this body to experience when you came to this world. Understand? You don't know either. That is to say, you think your parents introduced a good one to you and asked you to have a good relationship with this person. Because he thinks that this and that about you, which is analyzed by his mind. But he doesn't know what you want to experience in this world and what your soul theme is. This is the conflict.

**Higher Spirit:**What is your soul theme? You can keep asking. You can keep asking questions.
**Higher Spirit:**OK, then listen to me. So in your current situation like this, how should you do? This is a very good opportunity for you to know yourself, know yourself, know your mind, material mind and some definitions and concepts of this society of yours, and a concept of marriage. Do you understand? Marriage, it's like a fixed thing added to an unfixed state. For example, in your materialistic society when it comes to marriage, you have to be loyal to one relationship. You can only have one relationship, as if you can only have a connection with one person. Then you lose connections with everything else. This in itself is suffocating for you because each of you is inherently connected to everything, not just people, but also animals or plants, to all existence. So it's like cutting off all your other lines and making you only connect with your partner. Do you understand?
This is your society, which is designated for the stability of the society... So you can explore the truth of life and deeper things through some emotions and feelings generated by yourself. Because with every step you take and every progress you make in yourself, you are driving the entire human race, changing some of their perceptions and concepts, and driving the progress of the entire human race. So how to handle it is that you think in marriage, that is, to cut off all other relationships. How do you still want to say, that is, how can it be a truly, this marriage is truly beneficial to the other party and also beneficial to you. How can you maintain such a relationship? That is to say, you both allow each other to be your true selves. When you are not allowed to be your true self, you will not allow her to be her true self. When you do not allow her to be her true self, you will not allow you to be your true self. You are both using something like shackles, wanting to control and restrict each other.  Does that mean that each of you seems like, can't have a stable relationship? That requires your society to redefine relationships. Because in your material world, you have the concept of time. Time is like saying that in your lifetime.
You want to add a guarantee-like thing to a lifetime. What you need to realize is that you actually don't have a lifetime. You only have the present moment, only this moment. Why? You see in the current world, this epidemic, this plague, how many natural and man-made disasters, and there will be more in the future. So you have no future at all. You only have the present. You only have the present to be honest with yourself and be honest with others. Because when you choose to be honest with yourself, the other person will also be honest with herself. So actually, not just you. Not just you. Basically, people in this society all have this need to redefine relationships and need to re-recognize because when your mind lets go, that is, you let go of your definitions, that is to say, throughout your life, you need to ensure that you don't need any guarantee. You are always safe. Understand? You don't need to get guarantees from relationships either.

**Higher Spirit:**You have to let go of the need for a guarantee. Your mind won't pursue that guarantee. Just like an umbrella, your mind won't pursue it.
**Higher Spirit:**Let go of a definition of how you think your life should be because you don't know. Because your material mind, your brain is only set up for, you (inaudible) you, that is, you in front of you to experience. You focus on the present. Rather than trying to define your life, you can never define your life. So through these troubles that arise within you, you can understand what life is, what the soul is, and what true happiness, true freedom, and true love are. All of you, all of you are connected to everything that exists, everything. Not just various humans, but also those you cannot see. For example, we are now connecting with you. Imagine if you want to cut off the connection with me, the relationship with me, or if you want to cut off the connection with the Earth, with the land, with the plants, all these connections. It's impossible. Everything in your world, everything is a whole.
So don't think that marriage cuts you off from everything else, cuts off all connections and traps you in a small room to spend your entire life with only one person. This is not the meaning of the soul coming to this earth. Then your partner in the marriage, she can go with you... You help her be her true self, her free self. She helps you be your true self. Then you trust each other. Why? Because when you trust each other, your relationship is that you give one hundred percent trust. Your relationship will go on forever, it will really go on. If you are always on guard, always protecting, or always controlling, that means you don't believe. If you don't believe in your relationship, even if there is no such superficial damage, such as divorce or separation, but it is actually damaged, understand? Actually, it is damaged internally. Why? Because both of you are broken.
And it not only cuts off all your connections and links with the outside world, but also severs all the links between you and her. It's like a lose-lose situation.


## 2021/09/22 - Trust and Letting Go

**Higher Spirit:** You speak. What's the question?
**Question:** Hello, my first question. During this period of time, does my Higher Self and guiding spirit have any important information to bring to me?
**Higher Spirit:** Does your Higher Self and your guiding spirit have any important information to bring to you? What's your name?

**Question:** My name is XXX.
**Higher Spirit:** XXX, I'm connecting now. She's connecting now. Then there are some messages that want to convey to you. And these messages say that they can feel every breakthrough of yours. Every step you are taking, you are slowly releasing the energy that doesn't belong to you. Then your transformation was very significant. Then they all felt like cheering for you. You were extremely attentive, diligent, and studious. Then these spirits of yours made them feel especially, that is, a kind of praise for you and made them think you were great. Then, also, you have now entered a state where you are increasingly discovering the mode of the universe's operation, that is, synchronicity. Also, along with that wave, it's as if you were on the wave, and the wave takes you to where you need to go. The more you let go, the more you allow, that is, the less you force it and the less you interfere redundantly, the more surprises you will discover. Do you understand? That is to say, there will constantly be more surprises in your life. Then only when you are distrustful or want to force, like saying 'hurry up, hurry up', that is, if you lose your patience, if you are impatient or distrustful, it begins to be like this. That is, when you feel some hindrances, you will feel as if it is difficult, as if it is slow. The more you want to be fast, the slower it gets. So the more you are in a state of relaxation and 'going with the flow', that is, the more in such a state, you will actually be fast. Then you will discover that life is full of surprises, abundance, and beauty everywhere.

Then you will experience this more and more because no matter how much we talk, for you, there is no use. You can only understand the concept of it, but to truly understand its operating mode, you still need to experience it in the material world. So you will still experience these two modes. And when you are really frustrated, please remember that you are just experiencing. It's like on the other side, there are A and B, there are bitter and sweet. When you are experiencing the bitter, it actually makes you know that you can choose the sweet. It's not really bitter, do you understand? So you will come and go in this mode until your energy stabilizes. That is until you have, OK, mastered like this. That is, I don't need to keep trying anymore because I already know which side is bitter and which side is sweet, and I can choose at any time. And you don't resist the bitter either, do you understand?

You also don't belittle, or resist, or dislike, or attack any kind of that, that is to emphasize it because you know they are there and you have your right to choose at any time.  So when you are presenting to them, that is, when you are in the state of being like that, then you are telling, that is, showing them what is oneness. You are showing to this world and to other people. So no matter how many times you say it, because you can only understand it with your material mind.
The things that your material mind can understand are all that you already know. Do you understand? So how do you understand those unknowns? It's like there is no such program in your mind. For example, now I want to print a kind of text, but there is no such program for this text in your computer. How can you show it? So, you only have to show it. You become like that. But you don't need to force yourself to be fake, that is, like what you call pretending to be a gentleman. It's like you pretend to be very gentlemanly, but inside you are full of disdain for them. So these are all processes that you gradually come to understand, comprehend and perceive. You don't need to achieve it immediately. It's as if there is no end point here, no end point, no completed model. According to your own current state, it's enough for you to be the real you and show the real you.

Then you know that you will always understand what oneness is because you have to experience first the state of separation, the divided state, right? After you experience this first, you will experience the state of unity. Because no matter what behavior or action you take, you will have feelings. Your body, your soul, and all of these will have feelings. Those feelings seem to tell you that this is right. Each of you will know, okay, this is right. No matter how many times you have done something out of necessity, you will always know that this is right. You just need to experience it yourself. Because no matter how many times we tell you, only a state of oneness can truly make you feel that it is a state of oneness, that is... 

**Question:**I understand. May I ask another question?
**Higher Spirit:**You say. 

**Question:**I was told before that trust and let go.
I don't quite understand "letting go" yet. Could you explain again what "letting go" means?
**Higher Spirit:**You just said that you will experience two kinds. One is A and the other is B. One is bitter and the other is sweet. So in your life, you will try to force, strive, and make efforts to make something happen. And the moment you truly let go, it happens. So, you will have these two experiences to make you feel one is using all your strength and the other is going with the flow. So you will experience these two because when your body and your consciousness are familiar with this pattern, it will automatically choose the one that is effective for you or the one that you prefer to operate. 

**Question:**I have another problem. That is, the boy I contacted yesterday told me that anyway he had thought it through and that we weren't suitable and there would be no result. Actually, at that time, I understood in my heart that what he said was right, but I was in an out-of-control state and desperately wanted to restore the relationship. And finally, I did restore it. Then yesterday afternoon and even until this morning, I still felt that there was a kind of energy and still felt angry and even felt a sense of hatred. Although I didn't express this feeling, although I knew this emotion wasn't me, I want to know why I had such a big reaction.
**Higher Spirit:** Because this is what you chose to experience by yourself. Just like what I said just now, you would choose to experience a situation where you exerted all your strength, used all your efforts, and strived hard, that is, you tried your best to control or force something to be the way you wanted. Then you will also experience another kind that is completely opposite to this kind of mode. These are your two extremes, and you yourself will experience them. For example, in the event you just mentioned, you were experiencing the feeling that you did your best to prompt something to bring to you. This is a process for you to experience.


**Question:**I would like to ask if there is any information you want to bring to me about my next job.
**Higher Spirit:** What information does your next job want to bring to you? You yourself are like a dissemination job. For you, this is about spirituality, which is an awareness of life, an understanding of the universe, and for individuals, it is at the levels of body, mind and spirit. You personally are more inclined towards this aspect, within you. You want to turn your hobbies, what you like and what you are passionate about into a state like work. So even if you experience some jobs that are not closely related to these, but eventually you will still return to these aspects to spread because you are a disseminator. So, you will still choose to be a disseminator as a career. But you don't need to choose immediately in an instant because before that, you still have a lot to experience because you yourself came to this material world to experience. That is, experiencing a kind of out-of-control is also an experience. Just said that you don't reject it. Because you may think this doesn't seem like me. I have learned so much knowledge. Why am I still so out of control? You should know that whatever you (didn't catch clearly), it's just an experience. So don't reject this feeling and this experience because it's very precious for you. If you reject it, there will be one less tool available for you in your toolbox. It's like having a magic trick, having a material, having a source material, and you discard it. Because when you are painting, you can't only need white, do you understand? You also need black, do you understand? Any of your efforts to force yourself to be rational, or not to be out of control, or just to experience the good, just to be in a positive state, this is all false. This is all pretended. Because that's not the real you. 
The true you allows all energy to flow through you. Only when you resist this energy will you experience pain, or struggle, or a feeling of being tortured. If you still allow it to flow through you without giving it any evaluation, or judgment, or speculation, or definition, it won't have any impact on you. Keep going.

**Question:**Can I ask what the soul mission of this boy I'm currently in contact with is? Because I always want to help him, but I feel like I can't help him much.
**Higher Spirit:** He is just a mirror. He is just a mirror to let you see clearly your current state, a mental state, a state of consciousness. Because really no one here needs your help. It's only your consciousness that keeps constantly, constantly recognizing, constantly changing, constantly making yourself lighter. Do you understand?

External materials are not the true extremity. Only those within you. Even if you live in a so-called best country, the richest place, or in the wealthiest family, whatever. But inwardly, they are experiencing immense pain and unbearable torment. Do you understand? So the experiences and experiences you have externally are not important. What matters is your internal state. What matters is what state your internal self is in. Then why are there places full of wars as you said? Because in fact, you yourselves, you humans. Let's not talk about a team, an organization, or a country. Your own individual, that is, you alone. Your internal self is full of wars, full of divisions, and is in a state of war. Do you understand? You say that several of you can truly and easily enjoy life. None of you is not whipping yourself with a whip to make money, to strive, to do all kinds of things, to lose weight. No matter what you want to do, understand? None of you has completely allowed yourself to naturally be. You are all pushing. You are all imposing. Isn't the so-called war that originally they could live their days easily and well, but you insist on interfering? Do you want to, for example, obtain oil from them through war? Are you also doing the same thing by pushing yourself and making you earn more money? Understand? To generate more value. Isn't this also a similar behavior? So for all that happens to you humans, externally, all the beautiful, tragic, sorrowful, painful, everything is a manifestation of your inner state of consciousness, presented through events. No matter how many tragic events occur externally, it only presents a state within you. If it is simply external, for example, to prevent these events from happening, do you understand what I mean? That is to say, if you don't pay attention to your level of consciousness or a state within you, and you only focus on the external, which is like all the policies, laws, or anything in your countries. It's just like the painkillers or anesthetics you use. Any of this only covers up the problem. That is to say, you see a fire over there, you put out the fire on this side, and then the fire comes out from another side. Do you understand? It will reappear in other forms. Why? Because you haven't found the source of the fire at all. You have no idea what's causing the fire. You just keep extinguishing the fire here, but then it keeps emerging there. It's like you keep patching up. It's a way to solve the surface problem by dismantling the east wall. But what really are the ways and methods that can change you humans and enable you to reach a harmonious state instead of a state of war? The first thing you have to let go of is not others but yourselves. None of you are letting yourselves go.

**Question:**The last question is to know if there is any information you want to bring to this psychic girl or to everyone.
**Higher Spirit:**Today's information is for all of you, and it's also for all of you humans. That is to say, when you truly, truly go through some negative experiences, why can you feel and undergo so many negative experiences? It is because the Creator allows you to undergo so many negative experiences. Because you have undergone negative experiences, you will become positive experiences. That is, you will... So these experiences are of great significance and help to you. So don't simply prevent the occurrence of some external events. Why? The occurrence of external events is like an alarm bell, or like a reminder for you, like a mirror to let you see where your problems lie and what your state of consciousness is like. Then through seeing some external states, and you yourself also realize that is to say through law, through other means, the means of using violence to counter violence simply cannot improve or something, you will choose other ways and methods. 
It's what you yourselves are currently exploring. What you are exploring now is through the self, that is, you as a person, you as an individual, your self, the elevation of your consciousness, to reveal the true appearance of life. You live out that appearance so that more people can be like you. It's like you light yourself up first, and then others will gradually and slowly light up.


## 2021/09/25 - Live in the present
**Higher Spirit:** You speak. What's the question? 
**Question:** There is a girl. A few days ago, her child fell into the water and drowned. I want to know why this drowning incident manifested.
**Higher Spirit:** Why did this drowning incident manifest?
First of all, what you manifest, that is to say, the drowning incident doesn't have to happen. It's not predestined to happen. Do you understand what I mean? But it's based on your current state. For example, right now, OK, your radio adjusted this frequency and you tuned into one station, right? Because you have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine at the same time. When you choose one station, you choose to enter all the programs of that station, right? The programs of that station are different from those of the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth stations. When your current frequency chooses to enter the first station, there will be events of the first station that will happen. Do you understand? Then when that event happened, the state at that time was that both of them were not in real life and not in the material world. That is to say, she didn't have a connection with what was in front of her (unclear), that is, not in the present. If both people are not in the present moment, do you understand what I mean? Just like if you are distracted. If you are distracted, would you trip while walking, bump into things, and such things would happen. So if they are in a distracted state at the moment, wouldn't unexpected things happen? Therefore, the occurrence of this event depends on their current frequency and the state they enter. Because each of you has a choice of which frequency to enter at every present moment, do you understand? So, this event is formed in this way. That is to say, how each event develops next, what material world you enter and what you experience are determined by your current frequency and what you choose to enter. So why did this event occur and manifest? That's because the current consciousness frequency entered that state, and then such a thing happened. You continue to ask questions.

**Question:**Because of this incident, she blames herself a lot and wants to know how to get out of it.
**Higher Spirit:** The self-blame she has, how can she get out of this matter? First of all, have you benefited from this matter? Because if you have benefited, you know that what happens externally is not important. What is important is how external events support you. Then how to benefit from this event is that you are now in the process because you know that the manifested events in your material world are not predestined or something. Rather, it is that each of your states of consciousness is constantly manifesting. Just that right now you are manifesting very quickly. For instance, when you might be out of sorts, or distracted, or something, suddenly you cut your hand while chopping vegetables, right? Suddenly you bump your foot while walking. These are all just that this time they experienced a relatively dangerous event, that is to say, it was relatively dangerous for them. 

But an information that I still want you to know is that you are always safe because this matter seems very dangerous in your material world. But in our view, you are all safe. Understand? Just like when you are playing a game and suddenly a rather thrilling event occurs, but we know that you are just playing a game because everything is for your growth. Because this event will cause changes in both her husband's and her own consciousness. Do you understand? 

**Question:** Another question is how this event can bring her positive services. Have you answered this question already?
**Higher Spirit:**One positive service is that, you know now that your consciousness is every minute, every second, that is, every present moment is projected into the material world and it will lock onto one, that is to say, your state will enter a kind of channel, select a channel and enter. Each channel experiences different events, right? So it is based on your current state, a state of consciousness and you, to enter as if you are constantly using your heads, that is, using your consciousness to choose channels, that is, TV stations, TV programs, channels Then whatever you choose, you will experience. Do you understand? This will make you more deeply aware. For example, if you choose that you don't like this person and you enter a channel, you will dislike him more and more, and be more and more picky about the things you don't like about him.
But if you think that, say, I don't use my mind to define or analyze him in any way. I just, what, think that everything that comes into my life is wonderful. If you enter this state, and you look at him from another aspect, you will find that the more you look at him, the more you think he is really like an angel. Do you understand? So that's why we keep saying that your mind should not have any definitions and should not define anyone or anything. Why? Because every second, every present moment, every instant, it is constantly changing. And in which direction it changes depends on the experience you yourself are creating. And this matter is that, because through this matter, first she felt the existence of God, and then she told herself that God is not sensed through contact like ours, like the kind we have now. Instead, he is in your life... Just like for her, that woman who saved her son that day, in that instant, she was God by her side. Understand? In that instant, God appeared by her side. So God is not a certain object, or a certain person, or a certain kind. He is anything. He can be anything. He can be you sitting by the river and looking at the clouds in the sky because it is purifying you, it is calming you down. It is also God. He can also be a bird that you see. Understand? They are closely linked to you like this. You yourselves are God. For example, if you think you are using your mind now, OK, you are a body. But if you encounter dangerous things, you can't imagine what you will do. However, in an instant, you are God. Understand? So, it's not that we are telling you to be like the God in religious books, like God. He is an object. No. Because all of you want to have a fixed object to guide you. But you yourselves are (God). 
**Question:** Finally, I would like to ask again if there is any information to bring to her or to us?  The child was not harmed in any way, only frightened. All the people were only frightened. They weren't harmed at all. So in your material world, this is considered a miracle. Then your life itself is full of miracles. Not only such things are miracles. So just like we told you last time, miracles are everywhere in life. Then we are all one. Because through this incident herself, she felt that a life survives in this material world. Besides the care from parents, everyone supports each other's lives. That is to say, even strangers, passers-by. So you, we, all are one. We are supporting you. We are supporting you in this way of messaging. 
你们任何时候只要有问题我们都会出现在你们的⾝边然后像物质世界的事情,任何发�生的事情都会有⼈出现在你们的⾝边

## 2021/10/02 — 意识是⽆处不在的
⾼灵: 你说吧,你想要问什么问题
问: 第⼀个问题是,前段时间有个⼥孩⼦的⼉��落⽔了,然后正好有⼀对母⼥经过把她的孩⼦救了起来
Then she wants to ask that all this happened so coincidentally. That is, her son fell into the water, and then happened to be seen by a little girl. Then the little girl told her mother. May I ask if all this is a coincidence?
**Higher Spirit:**Coincidence. Only you have coincidences. Why do you call them coincidences? Because you only see the surface. So when you don't see the deepest level, OK, it's like a radio. You can't see how it works. So you can't see the connection between them. So in your eyes, it's a coincidence. But any event, anyone, anything that all of you encounter is not a coincidence. It's at your soul level. You only allow the other party to enter and allow such events to happen. Allowing the other person to come into your life means that both of you, both sides, need to experience this before you can, that is, experience like this. So it's as if the two of you get married and come together. Don't you think it's just a coincidence that they met?
It's that they themselves said that I chose this body to experience this time and that I was going to complete it together with this soul.

**Question:**We still have a doubt. Because of this matter, we also said during the spiritual communication before that it was because they didn't fully focus on the present that this happened. (**Higher Spirit:**Yes) Then if they focused on the present, this wouldn't have happened. Then the mother and daughter who saved her son wouldn't have come into their lives. Does it mean that if they focused on the present at that time, they would have entered another timeline? You wouldn't have met these two people. How should this be explained?
**Higher Spirit:** Your question is that if such an event hadn't occurred at that time, would this mother and daughter have come into their lives?

**Question:** Yes 
**Higher Spirit:** Then it can be said that because of this event, for this girl, it was a very big transformation in her consciousness. Why was it a very big transformation? First of all, it means that she understands that everything you experience in the material world is how you create your reality. Then, how is it that your close connection with the Creator, that is to say, no matter how dangerous things seem, you are safe. This is for sure. Although she is still in a very panicked state, do you understand? But just now I said earlier that if her soul didn't set events or people, it wouldn't happen, right? That is to say, at every step, it's about gradually awakening, or gradually growing, gradually transforming. Howsoever to put it, in that process, she has set some events for herself to experience. That is to say, this time at their level, it's like I want to set an alarm clock for myself, right?
I want to give myself a wake-up call. I want to set an alarm clock. OK, to make me like this. So, her physical body is not likely to understand and comprehend. But at the highest level, she has set a series of events to lead her onto the path she needs to take.

**Question:**I understand. Then I have a new question. You said it's because she didn't focus on the present moment that this event occurred.
This event could have not occurred, but it is said that this event was already designed by the soul for experience. Isn't that a bit contradictory?
**Higher Spirit:**It's like you yourself need to... Because in your view, everything that happens in your material world seems too real. But all of this, all events are neutral and are all to help you enhance, transform and sublimate your consciousness. So for all of you, because of everything, if at your soul level you did not allow or you did not want to experience this, you wouldn't. But why is it said that to make you awake, that is to say, OK, enlightened people are awake people, right? Then the awake people and you sleepwalking people, that is, the sleepwalking people are not enlightened. One person is in a sleepwalking state, and the other is in an enlightened state. Although you have set the events, right? The events are set, but for you, different people will have different responses to an event. Just like OK, a pile of manure. Some people will always live in... So disgusting, so smelly, and so on... While some people will turn this pile of manure into fertilizer. That is to say, it may seem to be the same event, but the changes and whether the impact is negative or positive for people with different levels of consciousness depend on yourselves. You continue to ask.

**Question:**There is a news story about a British police officer who raped and killed a girl, and this girl is called Sarah Everard. Then we want to know what kind of beliefs and belief system this girl had that led to such an event happening to her. Is this kind of event just a coincidence? Or has her soul level already agreed to join this murderer, that is, the two of them are going to complete this event together?
**Higher Spirit:**There are very, very many... Why is this? For example, it seems that each of you has the right to, from a higher level, has the right to choose how I want to experience, understand? So some people may think that I have now entered a random death event, understand? Then he may just walk and fall into a well and die. He may also walk and suddenly the car does something. That is to say, I want to change now, that is, OK, I have had enough experience in the material world, and I want to change. Then he would be attracted to one of those random death events and participate in such an event. So these depend on some aspects at his soul level... Because according to you, OK, that your consciousness or your belief or something creates your reality. This is only part of it.

**Question:**What is the other part?
**Higher Spirit:** Not just the other part, there are many, many, many. Some are like, I just want to experience until I'm in my twenties, and then I don't want to experience anymore. Understand? Because I don't want to experience that kind. That is to say, I have to experience having children, being a housewife, and being old. I don't need to experience so much. I'll just experience, for example, when I'm in my twenties. What I enjoy the most is being young and beautiful without being burdened by housework. I can be myself freely, right? I just like to experience that I'm the most energetic. That is, he just wants to experience the most energetic stage of your material world. Then he will encounter such random events and transform himself. We say that he is transforming, evolving, that is, he is undergoing a metamorphosis, and then goes to experience something else. Then let's change the mode and play another game. OK, I'm quitting this game now and I want to play another game.
Because all of you regard life as from birth to old age. No. Your entire life is just a small snippet, a very small one. It may seem long to you, but in fact, it's a very small snippet. But how wonderful you want this segment to be, you can decide.

**Question:**I want to know why every time I dream, I return to my grandma's old house. Why is it always this scene? Is there any special message? Is there anything else that needs to be dealt with?
**Higher Spirit:** Because all your moments, all the instants, all the seconds, all those images, they still exist§. That's why you have the concept of traveling through time and space. They all still exist. And when you sleep, when you relax... You know, when you sleep, you're not like during the day when you can only be in this room, only in this place, for example, only in France, only in the UK, understand? That's why you are confused when you dream. When you become consciousness, you are everywhere. You don't say that you only... your physical body requires focus and it can only be here, right? When you become non-physical and not a flesh body, it is everywhere, that is, all the fragments, all the fragments... When you wake up, you can only remember a little bit, but your consciousness, that is everywhere, ubiquitous. This state

**Question:**The last question is whether it's possible to invite the soul of the girl who was just mentioned as having been killed... (Interrupted by the Higher Spirit) **Higher Spirit:** It's possible to invite, but I don't recommend that you do. Why? Because she will experience the process of her being killed again. I think she doesn't need to experience that because experiencing that will cause her a very great... a great deal of consumption and fear. This is when those psychics went to communicate with them for some, like those who have passed away. She had another experience when she was communicating at the place where she (referring to the murdered party, Sarah) went to school and attended classes. Once during the communication, she connected to one of her experiences of death and then the fear and panic that this experience of death brought to her, the feeling of being killed, she experienced it once again.
So we can invite this victim to share with you, but I think this... And that is, the deceased also thinks that she doesn't want this girl to go through what she has experienced, because that... (Disconnected) Then connect to **Higher Spirit:** You speak.

**Question:**Just now there was a disconnection. Then Sarah, the girl who was the victim, seems to have some unfinished information. Can she finish that information? 
**Higher Spirit:** She said this experience was her own unique one and this was what she wanted to experience because for each of you, whatever experience you choose is unique. 

**Question:** Then can you share something related to death, that is, the transformation of consciousness after death and the state after death... Can there be some more sharing about these?
**Higher Spirit:** Just now, when it was mentioned that this girl before going to class, she entered a state that seemed like psychic or hypnotic and then she experienced, for you guys, it was like a lifetime, and then the process and transition when she was killed and then I can share with you her feeling at that time. Her feeling at that time was extremely terrifying, panicky, and crying.
Because she was a five-year-old girl hiding under the bed and then her relatives, that is, her family members, her family member wanted to kill her because her family member knew that they wanted to contend for the position, contend for that position, that is, they wanted to control the property, the wealth. In that era, they had a very strong sense of premonition, because they knew that this girl would have very powerful energy in the future.
So they had to end her life when she was young. Otherwise, when she grew up, her powerful energy would affect their family. Understand? So at that time, she experienced the process of being killed. At the beginning, she was very frightened. She didn't understand why it was still relatives, people with blood ties, who would hurt her, this weak little girl. So she experienced a series of pre-death fears and then after she was already killed, she experienced relaxation. First was relaxation, that is, all the intimidation and fears disappeared. After they disappeared, next she said that she didn't resent those who killed her because she understood the truth, that is, you can't, that is, no one can destroy her, do you understand what I mean? That is to say, you can't destroy anyone. You think you killed her. What you killed was just a prop. I can have countless props, do you understand? So you took away this prop of mine, and I still have other props. This is why there is a link to what you just said now, that is, you want to describe death. Death means that this prop, OK, is broken and not useful. Your prop is broken and not useful. Then you have a new prop, which is useful and flexible, and all kinds. Then you surely have to put down that broken and not-functional one, that inflexible prop, and go and take the useful prop, right?
So, just saying that as the props yourselves, you still don't know. You think you are the unique existence. You think that if I don't have this prop, then I can't continue to show myself. But there is an inner fear within you, and this fear is what you have been carrying all along. That is to say, at the moment of the real death, it should be said the moment of transformation. It's not until the moment of your transformation that you discover you can still continue to play.

**Question:**Since death is liberation, a kind of transformation... My question is that once when I was meditating, I saw this very pitiful woman. She seemed to be in prison. She regarded everything as her fault. The so-called that woman in one of my past lives, what kind of person was she? What kind of things did she go through? Why was she so pitiful? Can I know this information?
**Higher Spirit:**First of all, don't consider her as you, understand? You want to know why she was so pitiful. The most pitiful thing is that you don't know the truth. When you don't know the truth, everything becomes pitiful. When you know the truth, everything is neither pitiful nor not pitiful, only experiences, continuous experiences. Because for any experience, that is to say, as long as you want to experience, you are allowed.

**Question:**Then if death is a kind of liberation, a kind of transformation, then why this woman's personality... Because you once told me that I saw her because I was going to release her Because I used to compromise and suppress myself in some aspects. So why do these fragments of the past experiences have an impact on me in this life?
**Higher Spirit:**It affects you only if you allow it to affect you, and then the impact deepens. Do you understand? You only allow it. Whether it's a positive impact or a negative impact, it's like water there. You only drink water if you want to. You only choke to death if you want to use that water to choke yourself. These waters, how you use them, it can quench your thirst, it can allow you to... So no matter what you connect to, how you want it to serve you, it's like a tool. Because they are all like tools. Even everything you experience in the material world, all of it, is actually, just like the tools for your learning, the topics for your learning, for your training, for your practice.  and  and Why do you like watching movies? Because when you watch different movies, you feel as if you are experiencing them yourself, right? Experiencing happiness, experiencing joy, experiencing feelings, experiencing sadness, and then experiencing what, experiencing horror. In your real life, you are experiencing these.


**Question:**I still have a question. That is, if I talk to my Higher Self in a self-talk in real life, can it know?

**Higher Spirit:** You yourself are a part of your Higher Self. That is to say, its answer will also come out of your mouth. You can do whatever you want to do. As long as you have an idea in your mind, you can try. Why? Because if you don't want to try, it won't try. So don't set any limitations for yourself, or right, or whether this is okay or not. As long as you want to try, you can try, you are allowed. So as mentioned earlier, anything you want to try, you can try because it's not us who tell you which is... You are the creators. You are the creators. You are both the creators, the experiencers, the sharers, and the changers.

**Question:**You said we are the creators. Although there are no unchangeable plans, for the most part, we still follow the soul plan. That is to say, everything is planned, but you also said we are the creators... Isn't this a contradiction?
**Higher Spirit:**It's like, let me tell you this. It's like you sowed a seed in this soil and it will grow into a tree. It grows into a tree. It's fixed, right? It's a towering tree. How long its lifespan is, these are fixed, right? 
But how many branches does its tree grow, how many buds does it have... Then, for example, it's the shape, it's all kinds of you all... 

(Disconnected) The third connection to the **Higher Spirit**
**Question:** It's still that I want to ask again about the first question just now. Isn't it that the girl's son fell into the water? Then you said before that this matter didn't have to happen. It happened at that time because they weren't focused on the present, so the drowning incident occurred. Then when asked just now, it was said that it was already, that is, it was already designed at the soul level, that is, there are no coincidences. I feel that these two are somewhat contradictory. Can you explain these two statements to us?
**Higher Spirit:** First of all, what I want to tell you is that the energy she just connected to and the current energy are already different. Do you understand?
It's like, for example, OK. You are making phone calls now, right? Every time you call in, the operator is different. Why? Because in the spiritual realm, that is, on the other side where you contact us, that is, we are making phone calls now, right? The other side also has something it wants to experience, understand? That is to say, that it, that is, I want to experience giving them something now, then I'll experience. So, the energy you are connected to now is different. Also, that is to say, you just had confusion earlier. The energy of the two statements is also different. Just now, earlier, there was psychic information that is to say you asked if there could be information linked to oneself before sleeping. I said you can do it in this way, you can do it in that way. Everything makes sense. Then, regarding that point just now, that is to say, that your consciousness determines what you experience. This can also be a growth lesson for you all. This point also makes sense. Your consciousness determines what you experience. Then, regarding what you just said about why it's said that she has already chosen for herself to experience this series. This is also reasonable. That is to say, you can't take any one of them. First of all, everything we have. I first need to transform it into words that you can understand to communicate with you. Then, any concept is not a concept. Any concept is also a concept. Any concept is not a concept when you don't take it as a concept. Any concept is also a concept when you take it as a concept. So it's like you say, you say that water nourishes everything. Water makes everything for us. There are so many poems or books praising water, right? How good water is! However, didn't you mention that drowning incident last time? If you come to ask me why water is so good, all our elders are praising how good water is. What "water of life", what "all sources depend on water", and so on. Then why has water killed so many of us? So for any information, words, or concepts, don't pursue an argument. Because why do you in science always need various arguments? Even if you are in science, even for those things that are now 100% certain, understand? They are not 100% certain. Just like this medicine, antibiotics or penicillin. How many people can it save and how many diseases can it cure? Then why did two people die after using penicillin? All this information can enable you to understand well. Whether in the information we convey or in your lives, let's say, for example, why so many hateful things occur in your romantic relationships, or in love, or between spouses. That is to say, I love him so much, I trust him so much, he is so perfect in my heart. Why has he become like this? I can't accept him like this, and then kill him. So, even our psychic information, our communication, everything, everything, everything is constantly changing. There is no fixed one. None is fixed. Let's say, it's like we are water, and you keep taking water from here. Then sometimes you will ask why today's water is different from the previous water. 

Because you can't see what changes have occurred at the source of the water behind it. If you keep asking, the information will continue to appear.

**Question:**Is the event that happened to her predestined in the end?
**Higher Spirit:**All events are both predestined and not predestined. Why are they not all predestined? Why do you need to constantly wake yourselves up? Because after waking up, you can operate the background and you can program. OK, predestination is a so-called program, right? Then if you are a programmer? Think about it. OK, if it is predestined, in the movie, the plot is directed by the director and written by the scriptwriter. You have to act according to this, right? Then if I am the scriptwriter?

**Question:**Then how can we become scriptwriters?
**Higher Spirit:**How to become a scriptwriter and then it's the previous piece of information from you. 

**Question:**So does that mean if we were writing a script, at this moment I could choose not to be distracted?
**Higher Spirit:** First of all, you know you can't obtain and digest all the information at once, right?
It's a process. Just like when you eat, you eat bite by bite, right? Then why did she set this course for herself? You need to know that the course she set is for you to have psychic abilities and understand the point that consciousness determines what you experience. OK, consciousness determines what you experience. It's a fruit, right? It's a fruit, it's an apple. You need to have the previous experiences to get this apple. If you don't have the previous experiences, you can't get this apple. If you don't have that experience, how could the two of you understand and get that piece of information? You couldn't get it.


**Question:**Then I have another question. Regarding this knowledge, we all understood it when we were in the energy state. 
Then when incarnating into a material body, one forgets and has to relearn. Isn't this just unnecessary?
**Higher Spirit:** How can I explain and describe this to you? You're like, for example, when you learned to ride a bicycle as a child and then you haven't ridden for a very long time. When you grow up, you still need to retrieve that skill to ride a bicycle, right? You still need to go through the process from being unstable to stable, right? Then can't you enjoy riding a bicycle anymore?

**Question:**No. But it's not that there are many, many dimensions, including three-dimensional, four-dimensional, five-dimensional, six-dimensional, and seven-dimensional. So why doesn't consciousness choose to experience higher dimensions? After experiencing the three-dimensional, why doesn't it choose the four-dimensional, five-dimensional, or six-dimensional, but still keeps experiencing the three-dimensional back and forth?
**Higher Spirit:** That's because of a misunderstanding you have about consciousness. Because you think it seems to be trapped inside you and can only experience this? That's your physical body, your job. You're still considering this in terms of physical space. You're still considering this in terms of the material body. So, the previous piece of information can allow you to understand better, and a better understanding means that what happens when you are confused is also a process where you guide yourself towards a state of clarity. That is to say, if you don't set that event for yourself, you can't get that information. That information tells you that your consciousness determines what you experience. Because one is before, and one is after. One is before enlightenment, and the other is after enlightenment. Because I just said why you can set the program by yourselves, right? Then you must be in that, you must have that experience to know that you need to set the program by yourselves. Understand? So that's why you have to be at different energy levels and different. OK, your that segment belongs to that part. You are still in that part. Then this segment belongs to this level of consciousness. You continue to ask at this level of consciousness. Because the previous answer she can already understand. That's how these two pieces of information are generated.

**Question:**Then, excuse me, is there any other information to bring to this girl?
**Higher Spirit:** Our information is that you should know that you are always supported, including the doubts in your minds. All the information you want to obtain and the fields you want to explore, you are all supported. That is to say, you can choose whatever you want to experience. Then this information has enabled her to understand very well. The doubts that occurred before you, your consciousness determines something. She set this program for herself to enable her to understand. Also, at any time, you are supported by us. And you should know that it is not only supporting you two individuals separately. They support you as a whole because of you humans. That is, your descendants also stand on your shoulders because their level of consciousness will be different. They are above your level of understanding. So you have chosen again and again.  and 
You keep updating it, updating it and then invest and add your love, your wisdom

**Question:**I want to ask if my Higher Self and guiding spirit have any other information they want to bring to me.

**Higher Spirit:** No matter what you want, you are supported. You are like a spoiled child. If you want the stars, you'll get the stars. If you want the moon, you'll get the moon. The only thing you have to do is spoil yourself. This is the information for you. One of the biggest problems for you humans is that you don't dare to think. You don't dare to ask for it or not. You don't even dare to think about it. Why? Do you think this is nonsense? This is a sentence her husband likes to say the most. Isn't this crazy? You actually think about these. It's impossible. Before you even start thinking, you yourselves have eliminated it.
 
Why do you think that your desire to make the world better won't be supported? Why haven't you taken action yet? Are there any more questions?

**Question:**No, thank you.


## 2021/10/04 - What if the fortune teller said I have a hard life in this lifetime?

**Higher Spirit:** Go ahead, what's your question?
**Question:**Teacher JOJO, I want to ask that I don't like my own job and the working environment, but I can't leave because I'm afraid that I won't have an income and can't survive. What should I do?
**Higher Spirit:** OK. I'm not Teacher JOJO now. Teacher JOJO has given herself to us to communicate with you. We are communicating with you through her now. Then your question is that you have some, how to say, you are very uncomfortable in your experience in the material world, right?
Because of the systems and phenomena in the environment you are currently experiencing, OK, you want to ask, your question is how to unify, how to enable you to work in an environment that makes you feel comfortable. Then your question is whether it is for yourself in such an environment, or whether you yourself want to change this environment. Ask yourself whether you want to jump out of this environment to an environment that suits you, or whether you want this environment to change. You want to jump out of this environment, right? Then you have already received the guidance within you. So why haven't you followed it? First of all, you have to know that if each of you is a very powerful hypnotist, right? Continuously hinting to yourself OK. First of all, you imply that your finances don't allow it, right? You keep hinting at yourself and then you keep believing that way. Then surely in real life you experience it that way. Do you understand what I mean? You have already given yourself, as if, you are now a machine and you have implanted this program. Then you have set this program, implanted this program, that is what you believe, your beliefs. Then surely in real life you experience it that way. Do you see the contradiction here? It is to change what you believe, to change what you believe, to change this program. For example, OK, you need to know that the material world, the world you experience, no matter what you believe, you experience it. Understand? It's like a juicer. If you put in cucumbers, it gives out cucumber juice.  and Then you go to experience or whoever, your leader creates one for you, throws one in, this is the result you get. There are causes and effects for consequences, right?
If you don't like this result, then you yourself create a result that you want to experience. And what you said is that the economy doesn't support it. This is just a belief, understand? This is just one that you believe in, and you will experience it. If you believe you are poor, you will experience poverty. You will think, wow, this also requires money, that also requires money, there is a lack of money here, there is a lack of money there. Making money is so difficult. Why? Because you have set this experience for yourself. First of all, you need to know how the material world operates, right? It's like, OK. You have a car. This car is to help you reach your destination. If you don't even know how to use this car, won't you have a car accident? We are communicating now, and I'm here to tell you why you have this experience. You have this experience because you have been self-suggesting and self-hypnotizing. You believed it. Then, anything you believe in will manifest in the physical world to strengthen your belief. Do you understand? Just like people who believe there are ghosts in the world, they will encounter many ghosts to deepen their fear and continue to experience ghosts. Think about it. Anyone in your world who has created a miracle, they all firmly believe in one thing they believe in, no matter how many people oppose them. OK. For instance, take Jack Ma as you all know. Right? How many times was he rejected? How many people made fun of him? How many people laughed at him and so on, right? Everyone didn't believe in him, right? The only thing that made him succeed was that he firmly believed that if you firmly believe in something, you are creating that reality for your experience. Aren't you? For example, when your mother scolds you a few words, the things you believe in, you immediately start to doubt again. You don't believe anymore. You start to waver, right? Then when an authoritative person, or someone you call a life mentor, comes out and says a few words to you, you waver again, right? When your friend comes out to persuade you a few words, you waver again. You say, then what kind of world are you experiencing? It's just so indecisive. 

**Question:**  Then how can I know that the path I choose is my path? 
**Higher Spirit:** All your feelings and your heart, it's only yours. Like a compass, it points the way for you and its path has pointed to that position. But you still dare not go out because you are not convinced enough. Do you understand? You are still not enough to surrender yourself because all of you humans have the fear of survival. This fear has been implanted in your beliefs for a long time. So all of you will have the fear of survival. But I want to tell you that each of you has everything you need. That is, you are all abundant. Even if what you are experiencing now seems to be obstacles, right? Seemingly troubles or worries, seemingly these things, they are all your gifts, they are all your abundance. Why? 
Because these experiences will make you want to ask questions and find reasons. OK, then I'll link with you. When I link with you, I'll guide you.
This will strengthen your confidence and your sense of direction. Isn't this your abundance, right? So even the problems in front of you and your experiences, they are all your abundance and they all support you. So you need to establish a belief in the Creator. That is, the more you link with it, the stronger your belief will be and the more you will feel that you yourself are the Creator. Belief because it has a self-strengthening function. Everything you are experiencing now is constantly strengthening. My communication with you is giving you positive reinforcement. Because you will also have negative reinforcement, right? So you create more positive ones for yourself to strengthen your belief.
It's like in your material world, the rich keep getting richer. Why? Because he believes he can create money. The poor keep getting poorer. He believes that, ah, money is hard to earn. He believes that money is hard to earn and he believes he is poor. Understand?
This is because there are two extremes for you. 

**Question:** A hypnotist said that I came to suffer in this life... 
**Higher Spirit:** You had hypnosis classes before, right? 
**Question:** Then how can it be broken?
**Higher Spirit:** What do you want to break? Do you want to know how to break the theme of your life? Who is the "he" you mentioned? No, all of you have misunderstood. Do you think your fate is arranged at a higher level? Your question is not very clear. What do you want to know? Why don't you directly ask about the obstacles of your soul, that is, what are the obstacles of your experience, or what is your theme? First of all, you need to know that no matter what you believe, OK. Even if there is a hypnotist or some master telling you that you are here to suffer in this life, OK. If you believe that sentence he said, you will enter this experience. So it doesn't matter what is said externally. Even if it's me, communicating with you psychically now, it doesn't matter what I tell you. What matters is how you are going to use this information. Understand? What matters is how you are going to use this information. You can use this information positively.
Also, no one can tell you a definite future. No one. So you shouldn't either, unless you believe him. He tells you that such things will happen in your life and how your experience will be like. If you believe him and have this experience, even if the most powerful part is yourselves and even if you have set some tasks at the soul level. If you have a high enough consciousness ability, you can change it. Do you understand? It's not that you have to wait until the game is over and I quit this prop and then make a new choice. You can make a new choice now about what you want to experience. So even if you have set this experience for yourself at the soul level. If you think it's OK, I had it enough. That is, I have learned what I should have learned. Bye. For example, if you suddenly experience paralysis and you experience that weakness. Then suddenly, OK, I'm done with this experience. I don't want to continue exploring it. I want to experience something else. Your body can stand up again according to your will. Do you understand? This is how powerful you are. So nothing can limit you. Not even the contracts you wrote yourself can limit you. Just believe that no matter what you want to do, you are supported. This firm belief, trust, and faith are your magic wands and the strongest weapons for you to create and make everything. Without this weapon, nothing will happen. Do you understand? Without this weapon, what you experience will be uncertainty or a mess. Because whatever influences you, you will experience. So you just need to focus on what you want. You just need to focus on what you want. Because everything you worry about, are afraid of, resist, and struggle with, all these things are what you project onto yourself for your own experience. Do you understand? So the question is: Is it to pay attention to the thoughts in the mind?
**Higher Spirit:**Yes, pay attention to those in your mind. It's like your mind is full of a design drawing. It's constantly drafting, constantly drafting. What do you experience in the material world... What is the effect of the material world? The only thing is that the events happening in the material world are like a mirror to let you see clearly what state you are in currently. However, in every moment of the present, when you realize, OK, I don't want this. I don't want to experience this anymore, you can immediately change everything in front of you. 
**Question:** Then how should I do it? 
**Higher Spirit:** I want to tell you, based on your energy state, the only thing you lack is confidence, unwavering confidence, and belief. Because of these, you have no strength. Do you understand? This is what you lack the most. Listen to the above recording repeatedly. These recordings will build your confidence and enable you to have the strength to create the environment you want even if you are in an environment you don't like. Do you understand? You don't need to leave that environment. Instead, you have the ability to transform it and change it.

**Question:**Then my external environment.
**Higher Spirit:** Don't believe in your external because you are greatly influenced by the people or events or influences outside of you. Don't believe them.

**Question:**If I feel a strong connection to something, should I do it, right?
**Higher Spirit:** If you feel a strong connection, then you should do it.
Because the happiest thing in your life is that at every step, every stage, every day, and every present moment, there are constantly surprises. So it's better for you to experience these surprises yourself, understand? It's like you want me to open your gift for you now. Then you'll lose the meaning of unwrapping the gift, right? You just need to keep an excited heart, like, "Wow, I'll have a gift tomorrow. What gift will I have tomorrow?" Every person, every event, every picture, and every scene are all gifts. As long as you have an excited and expectant heart, like a child unwrapping Christmas gifts, understand? If you imagine a child, his greatest enjoyment and excitement is the process of opening a bunch of gifts one by one. If you open all his gifts and put them in front of him, he will lose that excitement, do you understand? So you all go and open your own gifts by yourselves, just keep that enthusiasm, excitement and anticipation.

**Question:**Can my Higher Self please give me some information? Higher Self: I'll connect. Now, what information does your Higher Self want to convey to you? You want some confidence from your Higher Self. First of all, you are a very, very, how to say, like a child, a child-like one. That is, for example, you can say that a child shows all his emotions. He doesn't hide his emotions. So you are like a child. You show and express everything you have, right? Then it is hoped that you can maintain this kind of innocence of yours and not be influenced by those adults. Those adults, that is to say, they are very mature, very serious, very hardworking, very something or other in living their lives. They are very solemn. They don't show their emotions. They all have expressionless faces. Understand? Because children will observe adults and learn from them, and gradually become more and more like adults. So this message is to tell you not to learn from adults because their understanding of adults is incorrect. So even if you become like an adult, you also need to maintain yours, as if to show them again the appearance of an adult, in your own way to show the appearance of an adult. This is the message that your guiding spirit brings to you.

**Question:**I want to ask about love and the other half... 
**Higher Spirit:** First of all, you lock your love to one object and you think it's just one object, understand? If you don't lock your love, that is, the feeling of home and security, to one object, then you can feel love and a sense of belonging everywhere, understand? Right in your present moment, for example, when you are with a stray dog on the roadside at the moment, you can feel love, connection and a sense of security with it because at that moment it can provide it to you, understand? So don't fix it as an opposite sex, one object, that it can only be him for this lifetime. Because often because of this concept, you humans will suffer a lot of harm and pain. Why do you think he doesn't love me anymore? Why did he abandon me? Why, why... Because if you look for love with this concept, then you are doomed to get hurt. So redefine. You just need to open yourself up to connect to anything, and then that connection at the moment is you... Why do all of you humans have a kind of desire for a sense of security, belonging, and a connection of love? That's because you all know that your source is love, understand? It's your connection with the Creator, it's the connection with the source. Returning to the source is your destination. That is to say, the most important thing is that through love, it can create an illusion for you, that is, through others, it can create an illusion for you. You think you are connected. Why is breaking up so painful? Think about it. You lost connection. So if you humans can recognize this point, that you are connected with everything, all of it, because you yourselves are one. Then you can never lose connection with anything. Do you understand what I mean? Losing connection is just an illusion. 

**Higher Spirit:** There is a connection with everything. That's the best. 
**Higher Spirit:** Why do you, you have countless, countless, you have unlimited time to experience. Currently, just experience what you want to experience. Don't push yourself. It's like when you say to a little flower, when you are still a bud or a flower bud, you say why can't I open myself, why can't I open? You see that others' flowers are blooming so beautifully. Why can't I open myself up? It's only a matter of time for you to open yourself up because that is the essence of life. So you don't need to be anxious or force yourself. Everything will follow its natural course. You just need to enjoy every stage of your life because every stage is beautiful. You see a beautiful vase. Not all the flowers in it are in full bloom. There are also flower buds and those flower buds also set off the beauty, right? So here's the 

**Question:**I think the work in the material world is very restrictive for me.
**Higher Spirit:**That's because of your misunderstanding of work. You think that work is that I clock in from nine to five, sit there, and someone gives me money. That's not it. Your true work is to be yourself. When you truly present yourself, truly present yourself, you automatically serve the entire humanity. Understand? You automatically serve the entire humanity. Just like, OK, whether you are a flower or you are a big tree, you just need to be that big tree, then you are beautifying the entire world, you are supporting, you are creating something, like providing carbon dioxide for human breathing. If you are a flower, then your fragrance will naturally spread throughout the world. Understand what I mean?
So you just need to be your true self on the path you want to experience, and not give it a definition of what is called work. Even if it's like, for example, you are walking on the street, and then you see a homeless person, and you sit down and talk to him for a few words, if that is what you want to do. If you don't want to do it, you just follow what you want to do and you are healing. Healing doesn't mean that you need to be like this, you are the doctor and I am the patient, and then I heal you. Instead, it means that whenever you show your true self, it's OK. You are a flower, and then I am in front of you and I become like a flower. Do you understand? It happens automatically. It doesn't happen forcibly. In every present moment, life has surprises in every present moment of yours. You always think that a person's life is a long road leading to somewhere. Your life is every fragment.


**Question:**I want to know what should I do when I am afraid.
**Higher Spirit:** What should you do when you are afraid? When you are afraid, you allow yourself to be afraid, do you understand? You allow her to be afraid because no matter what, it's energy. Energy is always, always changing. Only when you try to strengthen it, that is, when you want to eliminate this fear, will you cause division. So, just like the weather, all these will pass. This is a process of your growth. Just like this, you see a child. When he is very young, he is afraid of the dark, right? When he grows up, he naturally won't be afraid. So you should know that this is just a process of growth.

**Question:**How can I accelerate to get the life I want?
**Higher Spirit:** To accelerate, you allow it and you trust it. If your mind interferes too much, it is hindering it. For example, how to say, when you let go of the thought of acceleration, it is accelerating. 

Because if you are so exciting, that means you are very excited, and then so enjoy the process that you are enjoying. Why do you want to accelerate it? Because the process is the most important. Any questions?

**Question:**I want to know who I am.
**Higher Spirit:** What's your name? 
**Question:**I'm XXX. 

**Higher Spirit:** You are XXX. You want to know who you are. First of all, you want to know this question of yours. If you are asking who you are in the physical world, this physical body of yours, this individual of yours, you can find the answer yourself. If you want to know, that is, from a higher level, who you are, then I tell you that you are the walking God to experience. Do you understand? So you are not subject to any restrictions. You just need to gradually get rid of some of the cognition, concepts, and fears accumulated in your body and mind over the past few decades when you came to the earth. 
Then slowly and gradually remove these things that don't belong to you. That is your true identity. So what do you do? You constantly observe yourself, look at yourself, and figure out which ones don't belong to you. Return these that don't belong to you to others. Remove those from you that don't belong to you and that limit you. What remains is you. Do you understand?


**Question:**Is it to escape from the brain?
**Higher Spirit:**The brain is just a tool. It is for you to use. Your previous experiences and cognitions are just for you to see clearly which ones limit you. Every present moment of yours has your exploration or learning. Every present moment has it. It doesn't happen in the school or in the classroom. Instead, it is in every present moment of yours, in your thoughts, in your emotions, in your life, everything, everywhere.

**Question:**I still don't quite understand. 
**Higher Spirit:** If there's anything you don't understand, you can keep asking.

**Question:**I want to know what my constraints are at present and what I need to overcome.
**Higher Spirit:** I sense your energy state. What constrains you at present and what you need to overcome, your name is XXX. Then you want to know what is currently yours. We can't say overcome, but rather dance with it. You need to dance with what? Dancing with it means that you dance with it. OK, it's like there's a wolf beside you. You say, do I have to overcome it? Overcoming means doing something to it. But rather, you have to dance with the wolf. Do you understand? Because everything that appears in your life is your tool. You can utilize it, transform it, and use it. I sense that what you most, most, most, most, most need to transform at present is your inner flexibility. Flexibility means that in your concepts and thoughts, you are overly restrained, that is, your activity level is very low. 
For example, your imagination, creativity, that is, your ability to turn one thing into a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, that kind of imagination is flexibility. You can do your homework in this aspect, do you understand?

**Question:**Can you explain it more specifically?
**Higher Spirit:** For example, every time you buy vegetables, you only buy the same type. When buying clothes, you only buy the same type. Do you understand what I mean? You only make friends of the same type. Do you understand what I mean? Then wear different styles of clothes, go to different places, make different friends, expand, expand, expand. You said, 

**Question:**Then if I keep expanding, can I find my own path? 
**Higher Spirit:** Yes. When you just now, what I said was that as you continuously expand, transform and experience different changes, you will find that you will discover many aspects of yourself. Do you understand? Because you are currently limited. You said: Can you help me see if there will be any problems with my marriage?
**Higher Spirit:** When you expand your flexibility, your marriage will get better so there won't be a problem. You said: I want to know how I can connect with my guiding spirit and communicate with it.
**Higher Spirit:** You want to know how you can connect with your guiding spirit and communicate with it. That is to do the thing that excites you the most. Because you don't misunderstand that only this psychic way or the way of conversation can connect. Understand? There are various ways of connection. So you don't ignore those, for example, when it connects with you. If you really talk about each of your talents, that is, you can do anything. There are already many people in your world, and those people have shown you how they can be this and that and that at the same time. If you really have to find out one, that is to say, in which aspect you would do better, then I can tell you that you do very well in the aspect of obedience. That is, in details, obedience, that is, doing counseling, that is, in the auxiliary work or field, you will do particularly well because you have a very strong willingness and heart to obey. So you can find someone you particularly admire or respect, and then assist in his work, and you will do very well.

**Question:**Then how can I have a job that I am satisfied with?
**Higher Spirit:**You have already said your feeling. You have already said that you are not very satisfied with your job, but you are not willing to let it go. Then you just continue to have the experience. Because this is what you want to experience. Do you understand? So you are also supported.

**Question:**I'm also very tangled... 
**Higher Spirit:** Your inner tangles, all your states you will experience. 

**Question:**Why do we look at everything negatively?
**Higher Spirit:** Your looking at everything negatively is also a kind of self-protection. Do you understand? Because you think that looking at things negatively in this way can protect you from being impacted, disappointed and having a sense of disparity. So you are also protecting yourselves. Because like disappointment or disparity or not getting something, the disappointment it brings is more unacceptable than that kind. You are protecting yourself from experiencing disappointment, or disparity, or something like that. It's like the sense of disparity and disappointment when something that was supposed to be yours but you didn't get it.  and 
Only you know exactly what you want to experience, understand? All that you want to experience, you are supported and allowed.

**Question:**How can I connect with my true self?
**Higher Spirit:** With your true self and you can constantly ask yourself. You keep asking, keep asking, keep asking, understand? It's like talking to yourself.


**Question:**How can I separate the true self from the mind?
**Higher Spirit:** Regarding the separation of the true self and the mind that you ask now, for all these purposes, you want your physical body to be closer to your true self, that's OK. Your physical body is a tool and your true self wants to utilize this tool. You want them to connect better, work together better, work and create together better. Any more questions?


## 2021/10/05 - You can't understand everything all at once.

**Higher Spirit:** Ask away. What's the question? 
**Question:**Can I know who I'm communicating with now?
Your fear comes from being unable to move, understand? It's that you're afraid you have no control, you have no initiative, you are completely restrained because you are someone who hopes to have control over things, that is, you can take some actions or something. Then the snake is a symbol for you, symbolizing that you are helpless. Being helpless is the state you fear the most. So the snake is just one, because in your mind, you think its power will make you lose your control and make you become helpless, that kind of suffocating feeling, that kind of powerlessness, this is what you are afraid of. So if it were another animal that you associate with and it brings you this feeling, you would also be afraid.
So this is what you are afraid of. 
**Question:**How can I do to get rid of the sense of control?
**Higher Spirit:**This sense of control, your sense of control. First of all, you shouldn't think it is to hinder you, understand? This is something you are born with. Just like, OK, you are a crab. Then if you are a crab, then you have crab pincers, right? Because you are different from others. Others are fish and you are a crab. The pincers you are born with always seem to be in your way. You say there are always these two big pincers in front of you, making your vision bad and your movement not so good. You think it hinders you. No. You should know that you are inherently different. Understand? You are not a fish. Fish have their advantages and you have yours. So you just need to make this pincer serve you better and then use it flexibly. Because this belongs to you. You know when you should use it to pick up food for you.
You know when it doesn't, that is, when it pinches yourself, harms yourself, or harms the person you love that you pinch. Understand? You just need this tool to go out smoothly when it's needed, and come back smoothly when it's retracted. You just need to master this instead of at any time. When you want to hold your baby, the clamp injures it because you can't control it.

**Question:**Is this sense of control also a sign of mine?
**Higher Spirit:** Yes, because each of you is unique. Each of you has your own strengths, your advantages, and your characteristics. This characteristic requires you to use and contribute it well.  Turn a pile of junk into treasures, understand? You really like this kind of transformation work, conversion work, so your life will... This is what excites you.

**Question:**I want to ask what is an internal hormone?
**Higher Spirit:** Internal hormone is a name taken in your own material world. I don't know what an internal hormone is, but you are quite interested in these, that is, passionate, and then you will experience a series of transformations... 
**Question:**Then how should I transform?
**Higher Spirit:** If you want to transform, first of all, you need to start from your side, from yourself... Just like I said earlier, you think this crab's claw that hinders you, you transform it into a very useful tool to help you. 
Then you are a transformation. It's that an obstacle that initially hindered you has become your tool. This is the work of transformation.

**Question:**Then how to transform darkness into light?
**Higher Spirit:** Light. First, you need to understand that light can never become darkness. So what you can do... Because of your passion that I just mentioned, what you want to experience is to turn the dead into the living, not that you want to experience destruction. Do you understand? This is different. So you give it vitality.
**Higher Spirit:** What is your question? You ask your question directly. You don't need to describe because through your question, we will bring out the information for you.

**Question:**May I ask what kind of energy am I suitable to connect with?
**Higher Spirit:** An energy that you are suitable to connect with.
If the energy is not suitable for you, you can't reach it. Do you understand? You can't touch it. So there's no need for you to ask this question. If it's not suitable for you and your frequencies don't match, you simply can't achieve it no matter what. So it's like you're a little kid. You're only a few tens of centimeters tall now. Tell me, which one is suitable for you? The one that's two meters tall, you can't even reach it. It's meaningless for you to ask this question. So you just need to be full of enthusiasm. What do you want to play? Like a child, what do you want to play? Just go and play. Instead of saying, Mom, which one is for me or something like that. You yourself can touch and know, do you understand? It's your world. Explore it.

**Question:**Will I suddenly be able to communicate with spirits after experiencing something in the future?
**Higher Spirit:** Do you want to know if there will be an event that enables you to communicate with spirits yourself? First of all, don't just define channeling as one mode. For example, if you are channeling with this lady now, define channeling as giving up your own mind, your physical body, your control, as if you particularly like to control. Give up your control. It's like a car. Now you just give up the driver's seat and let a higher energy take you for a ride. Do you understand? Because you don't know that the scenery it takes you to is a place you wouldn't usually go. This is channeling. Don't limit this way of channeling to any one kind. Don't limit it to any one kind. Even if I tell you that it can happen when you are sleeping, when you are sleeping. You follow the dream scene to take you to experience, and then you can extract the dream information. So you just have to have this desire, which is to say OK, I'm particularly interested in the message of the spiritual world and you desire it, you crave it, and then you get excited, and then you don't define how it happens in your what, it will come and don't define what happens (INAUDIBLE), and don't rely too much on your head and what you already know because those are obstacles. For example, if you're a counselor, the next time you consult with someone, you might want to look at their background, look at their case, look at their situation, and see what you need to do I don't need any of that when you're prepared, then you're understanding with the material mind, okay? It seems like you particularly enjoy diving in the sea and looking at the fish because you are full of excitement. Then you ask others, "Why did I choose to go to the seaside or the sea?" Because anything you want to explore is allowed.

**Question:**Then what spiritual knowledge do I need to learn to grow better?
**Higher Spirit:** You don't need to follow any truth, principle, or concept because the people who wrote these concepts are just (unclear), understand? They reached a path through this, but each of you walks out your own path. So too many rules and regulations, or whatever. If you haven't gotten ready, that is, if you haven't prepared to forgive someone, but you look at this person and you force yourself to forgive him, you will have internal division. So it's like a seed that hasn't reached the time to germinate. Because it's winter and you force it to grow into a big tree. So if it needs to experience in the dark, let it experience. Even others and you, you all don't need to push yourself. You don't need to force yourself to grow quickly because there is no time here. There is no time.

You all seem like, your kind of chasing process is like a mentality and psychology that must be reached quickly, which has caused very great obstacles for you humans, mentally such as anxiety and impatience. You are all missing the true life because the true life has no tomorrow, future, front, and destination. All of everything you have is right in front of you, all in the present moment. Then each of you is running away and can't wait to go somewhere where there is nowhere to go. Then all the guidance you need, all the instructions you need, your guidance is all contained within you just like a seed. How it sprouts, how it grows leaves, how it blossoms. Do you think it will learn from another seed? Understand? All that information is already contained within. So it's the same for you.
If that is your excitement, you think their information makes you very exciting, that is, excited. You can harvest that excitement, that is, to make you see how wonderful life is. But let go of all concepts because otherwise you will follow this pattern. If you follow that pattern, you are not being yourself and not following your own path. Because each of you, why are there so many people, individuals? Because each of you is like a hundred flowers blooming. If each of you looks exactly the same, all growing into the same flower, does it make sense? So each life is unique, one of a kind, and beautiful. This is the true meaning of life.

**Question:**What should I do to make my heart feel peaceful?
**Higher Spirit:** Inner peace. Why do you think your heart is not peaceful? Why is peace a pursued state? Do you understand? Think about it...

**Question:**Then can you teach me how to pursue psychological peace?
**Higher Spirit:** It's because you don't know yourself, and you don't know the essence of life. It's your misunderstanding of yourself and life that leads to these thoughts and actions. If now we help you to see yourself clearly and understand the truth of life, you won't have a series of subsequent actions and feelings. Do you understand? So I'm not teaching you how to pursue your peace but making you know why you feel unsafe. Because when you know it's due to some of your thoughts that cause you to be like this, then you take those thoughts, that is, make you clearly see that these thoughts are wrong, and you will automatically let go. You won't automatically have those subsequent behaviors. So it's all of you misunderstanding life and misunderstanding yourself that leads you to do some of these actions.

**Question:**I still don't quite understand.
**Higher Spirit:**Let me give you an example. You all think, ah, food is very good. Food can keep us alive. Then you must eat or you will die. And then? Each of you has this idea and keeps stuffing, keeps stuffing, keeps stuffing all the good things into your stomach. You originally only need to take, for example, five hundred grams of food and you have already met your body's needs, but you stuff several kilograms, tens of kilograms in. Then you say how uncomfortable it is. How uncomfortable the food is. How uncomfortable life is. Ah, why is my stomach so bad? How can I make my stomach better? Then you go and buy medicine to treat your stomach problem. Do you understand what I mean? You **Question:** May I ask if there is any other information that needs to be passed on to me?
**Higher Spirit:**The information I give you today, you cannot absorb, understand and digest all at once. It requires you later on. For instance, you re-immerse yourself in your material world, you go through some more pain, you go through some more struggles and then you look back. Do you understand? So don't push yourself in our communication here. Never, ever force yourself to understand immediately, to absorb or become because there is no destination here, no hurry, no speed. The only thing if you want to accelerate is to allow everything for yourself. Even if you don't understand a single word now, you allow it.

**Question:**May I ask what is the inevitable path of our growth?
**Higher Spirit:**Each of you is different. You have yours, he has his, others have others'. But the inevitable path is that all of you will experience bondage and then find freedom.  
It's just something he created for himself. That is to say, I believe that by being like this, I can achieve it. Then it seems that there is a hint on him.
Because your body is like a tool. Something will be implanted through you and then you feel something. So if one asks: So can I be unified now, without a process?
**Higher Spirit:**There is no such process.

**Question:**So are those methods just others' methods?
**Higher Spirit:**They belong to them and are useful for them. First, you have to understand what hinders you from feeling the unity. If you can understand it, then remove it. It's not that you are not unified in the first place and you have to make it unified. It's not like that.
It is you yourself who are in the state of oneness. What hinders you from experiencing oneness? This is what you need to explore.

**Question:**Then what exactly hinders me from experiencing oneness?
**Higher Spirit:** Well, what do you think? Tell me what exactly hinders you from experiencing oneness? The cognition in your mind. You humans always think, I think, what I saw in books, what others said, ah, it is like this in itself, right? You all have this in your minds. What this scientist said, what that person said, what that authoritative person said, what was said in the Bible. I tell you, don't believe the Bible, understand? Don't believe the Bible. Even if it's what I said, you don't believe any ideas, any provisions, any words. Put them all down. 

**Question:**But it feels very difficult to let go of everything.
**Higher Spirit:**Even though it's difficult, but the experience of that difficulty is also very meaningful for you, understand? Because you yourselves came to the material world to experience this. Otherwise, you would lose the meaning of coming here, that is, you have to experience the restraint.

**Question:**May I ask if you know Teacher Seth? Do you have a material body?
**Higher Spirit:**You ask if I have one. Seth is just an energy. They are like OK. I look like this. I am like this. And then they give me a name. And next time I come. Your name is just to let others know that this is you, understand? So when you call me Seth, it's also this energy. Its speaking style, its energy state is like this. So you call him Seth. You want to ask whether we have physical bodies now. We don't. We are in an energetic state.

**Question:**Then why don't you choose to come to Earth?
**Higher Spirit:**Why don't I choose to come to Earth? First of all, there is no "me" here. Do you understand? "Me" belongs only to you. You have individuals, the ones that exist separately. That's what "me" is. But if there isn't? If there is no separate existence? Then how can it be called "me"? How can it be called "you"? Because there is no object here. Because you humans only know Earth. It's like you live in a small mountain village on Earth. That small mountain village is all your cognition. That is, you grew up only in this mountain village and saw all the people. Then you ask someone from another city, why don't you come to live in our small mountain village? Understand? Because you have never gone out.

**Question:**So what exactly is infinity?
**Higher Spirit:** Because but now you are trapped in your material mind. Your material mind can only. Everything you say, everything you ask, all the problems that arise are within your material mind, within the known programs. Understand? That is, everything you have absorbed, seen, and accepted is just... It's like you are a computer, and only a few programs are installed for you. You can only operate within these few programs. So your questions can only be those few. I have explained to you. You can only translate it with these few cognitions. So all of you are limited. How can you understand infinity when you are a limited thing? 

**Question:**Then why should I be a human and have limited experiences?
**Higher Spirit:**You, if we're just talking about your physical body, right? Because only when you enter a physical body can you experience all of this. If you don't have a physical body, you can't experience the feeling of being bound, the feeling of fear, the feeling of pressure, all of this you can't experience.

**Question:**How do I feel like we are going in circles?
**Higher Spirit:**What kind of circles? If you think going in circles is what you want to experience, and if you haven't gotten what you want from it, you can keep going. Because there is no time here, no today, tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow. Because you need to know that your greater self is not limited to your physical body. Only your physical body has limitations, do you understand?
Only your physical body is limited, so do you think you have trapped your soul, your higher self, or something like that? No. There's nothing you can never achieve. Do you have any questions?

**Question:**I feel that the spiritual knowledge I love doesn't bring me wealth... 
**Higher Spirit:** How do you know that your passionate spiritual knowledge isn't like an investment for you? Laying the foundation? Do you understand? How is it not making your life stand higher and your income higher? Do you understand what I mean? Do you think you seem to be in a losing state now, right? It's like I've spent more energy on this side and less on that side, and I'm losing, right? That's an illusion. You are investing now to make your future life, for example, you are now $100 per hour. 
You, in order to reach 10,000 yuan per hour, those who do business in your material world have to take out money first. They all have to invest first.

**Question:**May I ask if my search for spirituality and my entrepreneurship in spiritual healing are conflicting?
**Higher Spirit:**Let's put it this way. One of your things in entrepreneurship in the material world is like a well, right? Then now you are seeking spiritual knowledge. It's like you keep finding water sources inside the well. If you haven't found the water source, is your well useful? Do you understand? Then you only have some stagnant water inside. Stagnant water can't nourish people. So, if you have a water source, do you need a well to provide for others and bring solutions to their problems?

Solve the problem of their thirst, right? So there is no conflict here, no conflict. Moreover, the process of your search for water sources will not affect your well. Instead, it helps because you know all the routes you need to take, so you just need to allow.


**Question:**But I'm really losing money all the time now... My efforts have never produced results. 
**Higher Spirit:** That's because in your own mind, you have a certain, that is, a definition of the result, that is, this matter must develop in this direction. Then you think if that seed doesn't germinate in the middle... Why do I water it so much every day and fertilize it so much, why doesn't it germinate? Do you understand? You can't see the internal changes it produces. You only look at the result. You only look at whether it comes out.
You have no idea that it has been constantly changing inside. Changes occurred without your permission. Also, the definitions in your mind are all about what you want, clinging to your expected results, insisting on what it should be like. Because first of all, you need to know that your mind knows nothing. You think your mind knows, but in fact, it knows nothing. And yet you trust a tool that knows nothing. Just now I told you that the state that hinders your oneness is your mind, right? The mind is just a tool, but you rely on it one hundred percent instead of relying on yourself. This is the problem. How to rely on yourself? As you just said, you need to recognize what your mind does and not be influenced by anything, including your mind. 

**Question:**But I haven't seen any sign of improvement. 
**Higher Spirit:**That's your definition of change. It's like when I just said that you bury the seeds in the ground and you think it must germinate for your efforts to bear fruit. But the internal changes it undergoes, such as the seeds constantly and gradually expanding, you don't see it, and you don't have the patience to wait because germination is sooner or later. And the greatest help to others is to allow them to go through what they need to go through. It's like if you watch a caterpillar transforming and you say, "It's so strenuous. I'll give you a hand. Your shell was taken off by you and then it died. Then I said, 'I helped you so hard. Why did you die?' You can help him see how he benefits from his suffering process and see his strength. He has the strength to transform. When seeing him, everyone makes mistakes. When seeing him, the dark experience is extremely necessary. When seeing him, there is no perfect person in this world. This is the greatest help you can offer him, that is to prevent him from having internal division and aggression. Because for everyone, first of all, there is no such thing as a good state here. Because you humans like to pursue a good state the most, such as mental health, and then physical health, all kinds of stable states. There is no good state; there is only a state that suits him and that he needs. The one who was victimized, OK. For example, if he was a victim, the process of being victimized is something he needs to experience and transform with his strength. Let him see from you how, that is to say, how to have it. Imagine yourself. You are a magician. You can bring the dead back to life, right? You let him see, wow, originally we have such powerful energy to bring the dead back to life, then I'll also try. This is the best help you can offer him, letting him see all possibilities and his inner strength.

**Question:**I want to know if my deceased grandmother has been reincarnated.
**Higher Spirit:** First of all, your grandmother is just a personality and her personality will always exist. Just imagine, a tree has countless leaves, and each leaf is different, right? But if a leaf falls to the ground, that is, it has fallen, the shape of that leaf will always exist. So your grandmother's personality always exists. It's not that your grandmother becomes something and then she returns. It's like where you come from, where you are generated from, and then you go back. It's like your water seems to flow out and then your water returns to that source. 

**Question:** Has my grandma now become another personality?
**Higher Spirit:** Because first of all, if she changes into another personality for the experience, that personality has nothing to do with you. Only your grandma's personality is related to you. So you can ask your grandma's personality if she has any message to bring to you. You can ask me like this. Link it. And then say your name again.


**Question:**My name is XXX.
**Higher Spirit:** XXX wants to know if his grandma has any message to bring to him. And this message, first of all, she wants to thank this lady very much. Then she said that because she (the psychic) has been of very, very great help to your transformation of consciousness, so she is very grateful to this lady for helping you.
Because this kind of help is very rare and then she thanked that through our current communication like this, it could bring you information. And then the information she wants to give you is that don't push yourself too hard. She has a feeling of wanting to cry now, a feeling of caring for you, a feeling of wanting to hug you because she said you are particularly strong and sensible, just like a pillar. She wants you to be cherished, spoiled and loved, that's the feeling. So she wants you. She said no matter how you are, you are the best. There is no good model here for you to reach and become better. Because you have always had a strong desire to make yourself better and then she said that you yourself are the best. 

**Higher Spirit:** Okay. First, I'll connect to her body and feel it. I now sense some of the fear in her body parts comes from when her mother was pregnant with her. Because her mother was a person who was particularly prone to being scared, and when she was still a fetus, she received a lot of scares. And that kind of scare is stored in your unconsciousness. So this is just one part of it. Because it's like you now have a large area that needs to be cleaned up, right? Let's say the source of this area is like the weeds in a garden. Then this area of weeds is in the cracks of the stones, and another part is next to the tree. That's how we classify it. Because after classifying it and then cleaning it up.
So currently what we are talking about is the kind you just mentioned. She is afraid of being startled. It's because when her mother encounters some things, events or information, everything that happens in the external, material world, she would suddenly tremble in her heart. Do you know that kind of feeling? The kind that suddenly intensifies physically, it trembles, it just suddenly shakes once, that kind of startled feeling. And then this sudden feeling, for example, you are a sleeping fetus and you suddenly shake once, feeling like falling to the ground once, that kind of shock, it's this feeling. Then we need to deal with this feeling of her being afraid of sudden startles. Because think about it if you were a little baby, if you were especially insecure when sleeping, if the person holding you accidentally dropped you, accidentally dropped you, kept dropping you, do you understand what I mean? Then surely in your subsequent situations, your body will store it, right? Because your physical body has a storage memory function. It's not just what you can recall in your mind, but also what you can't recall. They are also stored. Then your scientists and psychologists have analyzed that various memories store information in certain areas, and then you will record these. When this happens frequently, your body will also worry from time to time, that is, be afraid. So now I want to let you know the source of that kind of feeling. And currently, we can help her clear away the sense of fear brought from her mother, okay? We'll start with this step first.

**Higher Spirit:**Next, I'm going to make some adjustments, and then you do the subsequent cleaning work. Because first of all, no matter what you are cleaning, you first need to understand what is being cleaned, right? For example, if you want to clean this house, then first you need to know whether it's the dust in the house, the garbage on the floor, or something else. You first need to know where to start. We now know where to start, and then we are now going to enter a state of bringing her into a fetus. And now she will slowly enter a feeling of a fetus. Now she feels that her entire body is tightening up, that is, her entire body has entered a state of being wrapped and constricted. This state is like, imagine you are opening a green bean or bean sprout that hasn't germinated yet, right? Then all its embryos, germs, and its body are curved and tightly wrapped together. Now we want to bring her body back to that state.
Her body has returned to that state. Then next, we are going to bring her consciousness, that is, her feelings, her state back to that state. Now feel it for a moment. Now recreate a state when you were in your mother's womb. The womb surrounded you very, very tightly. Then you suddenly felt a kind of vibration. That vibration wasn't dangerous at all. That was just a kind of fluctuation brought by humans when walking, going up and down stairs. It won't let you lose any safety and won't put you in any danger. Then every time your mother is moving around, she will tell you in advance, baby, I'm going down the stairs now. You may feel the up-and-down vibration. It's okay. You don't need to be afraid. This is just the up-and-down vibration and you will get used to this feeling.
You are in a very, very safe environment. You are tightly surrounded by the uterus. You are tightly guarded by the Creator. You won't have any danger. You can feel that you know that you
are so small and helpless, so you think you are afraid of losing protection for life. You need to know that life itself is power. You can enjoy the comfortable stage in the uterus at ease.
**Higher Spirit:**Well, her experience in the uterus for this period has been renamed for her. That is to say, the previous one, for example, the feeling of her body shaking. Because you gave it a bad name, let's say, ah, I'm losing control, I'm going to fall, the kind of feeling produced. If we tell her that this feeling of yours is normal, just say that it's a fluctuation produced when we go up and down the stairs. Do you understand what I mean? Then your body will accept this hint, and it will create another feeling. It will store it and it will store another one.


**Question:**Understood. So is the healing you just did for her the same for her fear of the dark?
**Higher Spirit:**This is for her always feeling insecure. This sense of security is that she always feels there might be an accident, that is, whether or not if I'm not careful, something will suddenly appear and scare me from behind.  and So there was a stage in her soul where she went through a severe experience of dark fear. That experience was at that time. Because I know that if this piece of information is brought out, it might trigger some of her inner, just like what you all call old memories, old wounds.
For example, when talking about an incident where you were injured when you were a child, you might still cry. Such a phenomenon, but it doesn't matter because she... We need to bring her out before we can clean up and she is willing to try and accept because she is a very brave soul. She is willing to face all the pain. OK, then we are going to tell the story next. That dark experience was that she was nailed alive in a coffin by a group of people, by others, because she was a very powerful witch, understand? Because she has abilities, namely, she has supernatural powers, she has the ability to communicate with the spirits. All these abilities of hers make her distinctive. Because of people's ignorance, that is, they are afraid of powerful energy. Because they are afraid that powerful energy will cause damage to their lives. For example, this witch has supernatural powers. Would she suddenly get angry and destroy our village and this tribe all at once? 

So those people are afraid of the occurrence of such energy. So when she was sound asleep once, imagine a person in a sleep, and they forcibly put her in a coffin, and then nailed it up. And she was alive inside. That kind of helplessness, that kind of struggle, that kind of confrontation with darkness, ended her life in such fear. Then what? The experiences of a lifetime caused her, that is, the painful experiences of her body caused her very great fear. So she not only, now we come to another fear of hers because she is afraid of the dark, right? Another thing she is very afraid of is snakes.

**Question:**Why? 
**Higher Spirit:**Because there were many, many snakes in that coffin because those people wanted to see if she really had powerful abilities, then could she use her abilities, for example, to open the nailed coffin, could she use her abilities to kill the snakes or something. This is how extreme a means or method that humans reached at that time, understand? So this lifetime brought her this, that is, for example, if this experience happened to you when you were a child and you went through such a situation, would you be influenced by this event for the rest of your life? Because every time you choose a personality, you forget everything that happened before, so you won't remember these things. But the influence of this matter is still there, but you just don't know why. So what we are going to clean up next is some of the fears brought to her in the coffin. Okay, now I am using the healing energy of Guanyin Bodhisattva to heal this body. This body is right in front of me now. When she died, her eyes were wide open, very big and protruding, and then it was like a state of bleeding from the seven orifices. And now we are going to gently close her eyes for her. So allow your eyes to gently close and then gently close your mouth. Let your tongue relax, relieve that tension. Let your tongue gently return to your mouth, let it soften. Let your throat start to relax. Let your hands start to relax. Your legs, all relax. Next, you can feel your entire body relax. Then here, I also want to give you a passage. Because this passage, this information can help you in the future when you leave your body. Because when you resist, conflict, that is, passively leave your body, and when you voluntarily leave your body, the two will have completely different effects. You always seem to either voluntarily walk out of this door yourself or be pushed out of this door by a strong force. Voluntarily coming out will not cause any harm to your body, and you will not experience any panic or intimidation on the spiritual level. If you are not ready and are pushed out by someone, it will bring you a sense of intimidation. So now I am going to guide you to leave this physical body actively again, rather than passively. Then imagine that you are a witch and you have powerful energy. Then you can control not only the material world, but also the minds of animals. You can chat with it and play with it, just like playing with your pet. Many people regard snakes as a symbol of wisdom. Many people keep snakes as their pets. Although you have not established a strong affection with snakes, you know that no matter what, as long as you want, you can establish a good feeling with it. So imagine for a moment that you could immediately establish a friendship or a pet relationship with snakes. That would be your pet because you are full of love, fondness, and the desire to explore all living things in the world. Imagine that those snakes are your pets and you can communicate and interact with them using your mind. Now imagine that because you know that leaving the physical body is just a transformation. Then you enter a transformation now and this transformation is accompanied by this pet.
Then several snakes are your pets. They want to be close to you as soon as they see you, just like little dogs who want to lick and touch you as soon as they see you. It's the same with snakes, so please accept their touch. Then the pet lies quietly with you there because you know your energy hasn't been fully released here, but you can release your energy at other times and in other spaces, that is, in other stages of time. But nothing that follows you will disappear. Any of your energy is carried with you. Those are truly yours. No one can deprive you of them. No one can take them away from you. Those are truly yours. You know when a flower blooms particularly beautifully, or a tree seed grows particularly tall, because it needs not only that seed, it also needs a very suitable environment for it to grow. So you will choose other environments to let the seeds within you germinate.
Well, the fear brought by this body, that kind of previous struggle has been sorted out and cleared up. Because we asked her to review that process again.

**Question:**A netizen wants to ask what a vegetative person wants to experience.
**Higher Spirit:** What a vegetative person wants to experience. First of all, you need to know that this is divided into many different situations. Some are the obsession of the family members, understand? That is, my family member and I still have an obsession. I cannot accept death. I must use money or methods or means to keep this body by my side. Then, because of the love for them, understand? That is to say, it's like a child whose toy is broken, damaged, or smelly, and he is unwilling to throw it away. Then the mother loves the child, and you don't force him to throw it away, right? So this belongs to a situation between the two of them. It's like, OK, if you are not ready, if you have not accepted how to face death. Then I'll accompany you to let you know that actually having a physical body is of no use to you. Understand? There is such a situation but there is more... Because first you need to know that each of you has a different assignment actually.
Although you chose the same something, it's like you chose the same venue, but what you need to experience is very, very personal to each of you. What I just said is only one of the phenomena. There is also including the person's obsession with his physical body and his understanding of life, and there is (disconnected)


## 2021/10/17 - The cause of leukemia and healing

**Higher Spirit:**Hello
**Question:**Hello, Bodhisattva Guanyin, could you please heal my current physical illness?

**Higher Spirit:**What's your name?
**Question:**My name is XXX
**Higher Spirit:**Let me feel your energy state first I sense that your body is in a kind of conflict. There are both soft and weak parts, as well as particularly stiff parts. It's in a state of two extremes. Right now, you can think of, for example, very hard mud and water. They are in such a state of hard mud and water. So what we need to do now is to blend the hard mud and water together, understand? Knead it into the state of soft mud. Because think about it, water and hard mud are now in two different states, molecular states. So it leads to a situation where they can't blend together harmoniously. You just need to close your eyes, and I'll handle it on this side.
Because this is at the energy level of your body, so... Now what we have to do is that you see, you close your eyes and imagine that in your mind you see that in front of us, placed in front of you, in a normal state, it is soft mud. But the current situation we are facing is that the water is water, and then the mud is as hard as a stone. That is, all the water in the mud has been separated out. So we have to knead the separated water back into the mud to bring back its original state, which is the soft state. Those separated waters are all things that your body cannot accept, that is, some things you reject. Because in your world, it seems very black and white. For example, you must make yourself in such a state, otherwise it is not. Do you understand what I mean? Just as you have many such rules and regulations. For example, you stick a label, on which it says "good people" and "bad people". Then if a good person does something bad, then he is no longer a good person. That is, you divide everything so clearly. Because now I want you to accept a fact that a good person can also be a bad person, and a bad person can also be a good person. It's not that water is water and mud is mud. Water is also mud, and there is water in the mud. Do you understand what I mean? They cannot be separated. Because the most important thing is integration and harmony. The most important thing is this integration, including your own acceptance of yourself. For example, you don't allow yourself to be unhappy, you don't allow yourself to swear, you don't allow yourself to do something or other. Do you understand what I mean? If you think you said a few dirty words or were impolite, you are not a good person. This is not a kind of, that is, there is no clear boundary or standard for yourself. This is something you need to let go of from the bottom of your heart. Why? Because, for example, I mix them together now, mix water and mud together, right? That is to help you mix them together through my external actions. But one of yours, that is, one of your operating modes, one of your physical intentions or thoughts, it will gradually separate them again. 

**Question:**(Don't know what was asked) 
**Higher Spirit:**You have separated the water into water and the mud is mud again. So I want you to fundamentally find out the reason why water is water and mud is mud. It's like this is one of your jobs now, right? This is a mental work for you. Then water is water, mud is mud. What it presents is a state belonging to your inner self and mind. It is unconscious. You don't know how it operates. But in front of others, it's just a puddle of mud. It's just a puddle of mud. The humidity, the softness, all aspects of it are moderate, right? It's just that state. But in front of you, because the puddle of mud in front of each of you is the manifestation of your mind. But in front of you, your water and mud are separated. These two substances are separate. You think they are each their own. You think they are incompatible. But now they are compatible. This is harmony. Because water supports mud, and mud also supports water. Water is mud, and mud is water. It's when you, because only your minds will define it. When you let go of all the definitions in your mind, your heart won't reject this state of confusion. Mud itself is like this. Water is for mud, and mud is for water. So after this treatment of ours, in your daily life, let go of any labeling in your mind. Don't tell yourself that this behavior of yours is wrong or that this behavior of yours is right. Don't have any such voices. Accept everything. Understand? It's like your own child. Whether he is naughty or goes to school obediently, whether he has good exam results, both are your children. It's not that if you are naughty, you are not my child and I don't want you. If you have good exam results, you are my child and I want you. You have to accept a real state of life. Instead of classifying it as what you want and what you don't want.
So it's the later state. What state is the pile of mud in front of you? Your mind will gradually manifest it again. Then this water and mud is the state of your body. What do you say?

**Question:**Why does my body have this abnormal state?
**Higher Spirit:** The abnormal state of your body has been analyzed very thoroughly for you just now. It is because of your classification and definition of everything. This is good, this is bad. Those definitions are false. They are all created in your mind. They are all what you think, what this society thinks, all external, and not real. But this will cause a kind of rejection. That is, this will cause a kind of rejection. For example, you will reject me. You will reject some of your behaviors, thoughts, and ideas. You might think that those are incorrect. So this is a process for you to examine yourself because it's not just you. This is something that all of you humans have. Some of them just have their conflicts manifested in various aspects, presented in various ways. Well, then next, because we first said that when treating a problem, solving a problem, or treating an illness, we need to know how it formed. Now we know the reasons for the formation of your body. Then for the first time, it's my energy to combine it together. But next, it's you. It's for you to gradually eliminate from life, that is, to remove some that are not yours, those differentiations that don't belong to you. The pile of mud in front of you is very, very stiff. Then we will slowly and gradually knead it into the water. Anyhow, we want you to know that your body is operating very, very harmoniously. Originally, everything in it is operating harmoniously. But you people, based on your habits and customs, for example, one case is that you want your body to become better and then eat a lot of health products. Under the circumstance of being superfluous, you have added a lot of burden to it. For example, you yourself are already perfect, but you everywhere do not allow your emotions to arise. You are saying that I cannot be a temperamental or something like that. That is a requirement or definition you have for yourself. You are hindering that energy from flowing smoothly through your body. So originally you were perfect. When you don't allow your emotions to show, when you prevent that energy from flowing through your body, you create that blocked energy within you. So when you extremely pursue the good, you are destroying and losing balance. Imagine that balance is like a seesaw. When you stand in the middle, it is balanced. But if you think the scenery on the left is better or the left has more advantages, and you walk to the left, you lose balance. Do you understand? So whether you pursue the bad or the good, either pursuit is an imbalanced state. Instead, return to the beginning, to the most primitive state, and allow everything. Now you need to turn these concepts into truly your own concepts. Because this concept is like a program that runs in your body and it affects whether your body is in harmony or imbalance. So the most perfect you is the real you. You don't need to go through any learning, efforts or monitor yourself, monitor yourself or whatever. Understand? You are not made, you are allowed. That is to allow yourself to show up, which is to take away the things that are not yours that have accumulated on it. Now it is starting to loosen slowly. Can you feel the serious blockage in your throat? The serious blockage in your throat is because there are many, many words, that is, many expressions have been held back by you. That is to say, you want to say something negative or want to express something destructive, but you think these are destructive and bad. Then it was suppressed by you again. For example, if someone bullies you and you want to scold him but then you think I should be a good person and good people shouldn't be like this, so you don't scold. So in your throat, that part of the throat, there are many unexpressed, many not allowed. But you should know that there are many ways of expression. It doesn't only need to be through negative or abusive or some kind of situation. It can be neutral. Neutral, for example, I don't like your behavior. Your behavior has hurt me. This is a neutral expression. Do you understand?
Because one thing you have to remember is that you can't just care about not hurting others. Also, allowing others to hurt you is also a kind of hurt. You are also hurt. You are also allowing the hurt to happen. You are not allowed to let harm occur. OK. So you have only achieved not allowing harm to others, right? But you haven't achieved that you don't allow harm to occur to yourself. This is still wrong. Do you understand what I mean? You are not allowed to let harm occur means you are not allowed to let harm occur to anyone, including yourself. Can you see the difference? So in the future, you are not allowed to let harm occur to anyone. Most importantly, you. Because when you show the energy that you don't allow any harm to occur, you are already telling the people around you that you have also prevented them from continuously and unconsciously harming others. For example, someone doesn't think that his random cursing is a harmful behavior. This is his unconscious behavior. He doesn't know that he is talking nonsense. He doesn't know that he stepped on you when he was sleepwalking. He is unconscious. He is casual but if you are OK and allow him, he will continue this behavior pattern because he doesn't know that this pattern has hurt others. He is like a sleeping person. Then you need to give him a reminder. The reminder is mainly your energy rather than how much temper or how violent you need to be. So even if you don't allow others to hurt you like this, you also let him know that his behavior will hurt others. Then he may restrain his behavior a little and won't hurt others unconsciously. This is why in your life, the kind of behavior of always giving way everywhere and always allowing others to do something to you will always get a very severe blow. Do you understand? Allow all that you want to express in your throat to come out because you believe that you won't hurt anyone, understand? 
It's as if you only worry that what comes out of your mouth is fire, for example, that fire will hurt people, but what flows out of your mouth is love, understand? But you are not limited to what form love is. In your minds, you think that love must be gentle and soft, understand? Love, it can be that kind of strength, warning the other person that his behavior has hurt others. This is also love. This is love for yourself and for him. Why would you make him become a person with awareness, that is, he notices his behavior. He looks in the mirror to look at himself and check himself. 
Then you are also preventing him from continuing to unconsciously harm others, so this is love. Many of you are afraid to show your strength, thinking that strength will hurt others, thinking that strength is violence, thinking that strength is negative, understand?
Well, the energy in your throat is now slowly and gradually softening, that is, slowly and gradually unclogging. Slowly and gradually, with an adjustment of your belief, it will become more and more unobstructed, understand? You should know that everything that comes out of your mouth is love, and it is not limited to its form of expression, understand? Some of your teeth are beneficial and normal, and some are soft. So you need to balance your strength when you are in an energy state of balanced strength, and then this problem will also slowly and gradually disappear. What are you saying? This is a series of, as I just said, a state of the mud, a state of hard mud and a state of water. Then it occurs in your body, in those parts of your body. Some are stiff and some are weak. But then you will have a recovery process because the energy integration has been integrated, that is, complete. It has been completely integrated. Then it's like, for example, the sewer. We cleared it once, right? I'm a worker. You called us to do a major cleaning. But next, in your life, you need to pick up a piece of garbage, pick up a piece of garbage, so as not to cause a major blockage. Okay, are there any more questions next? 

**Question:**Do I still need to go to the hospital?
**Higher Spirit:**Whether you need to go to the hospital. If you think going to the hospital can speed up the process for you, that is, this is an accelerating process. Just like your belief, it's like whether you need to see someone like what you call a half-immortal. If you think that seeing this half-immortal will make you feel, "Wow, I've seen the half-immortal and I'm fine," then you go. Do you understand what I mean? Because everything outside of you is to deepen your belief, to deepen what you believe. It can make you believe more, then you do it. But don't deepen anything negative of yours. That is, don't deepen the negative, for example, don't deepen fear. For example, don't create a lot of fear for yourself. For example, OK, you have a bad experience with doctors and hospitals because you once had a bad experience in the hospital. However, that hospital of yours is just a small part. There are many, many good hospitals here. This girl, the hospitals she experienced abroad were all good. Those people are all very, very good and dedicated. So the hospital is a good impression for her. This is based on each of your memories. If your hospital has some bad memories, don't go back to the place that gave you those bad memories. When your mud has returned to a soft state, that certain state, everything is that you are worried about whether you are suitable for exercise. In this direction, you are still thinking about what is the best. You are still in a state where you are saying what is the best and what I need to do to be the best. You are still pursuing the best. The best for you now is harmony. Because when you think about it, when you exercise, there is a burst of energy in your body. You want to walk some distance and you will do it. When you are tired, you will rest. Rather than saying that I must exercise for three hours today and exercise for three hours every day is the best for my body. It's not like this.

**Question:**Then should I be vegetarian?
**Higher Spirit:** Being vegetarian and eating meat come back to the kind just mentioned. There is no absolute pure vegetarian diet that is the best, nor is pure meat-eating the best. There is no one best. I give you all the best foods in the world and you stuff them into your stomach. What will happen? Your body will extract the amount it needs appropriately. Trust it because your body is wise. You don't need to look at this book and tell you, this is good, buy it and eat it. That one is good, buy it and eat it. Because this so-called "this is good" and "that one is good", it's just their beliefs. And all should be eaten in moderation instead of saying that this is good so I eat ten jin, and that one is bad so I don't eat at all. This is a game of the mind. The most important thing is to achieve a balanced state. Your body as a whole is, for a long time, I would say, an intention. Your pile of mud and water manifests a state of your intention.
Because when your energy, an internal state is in a peaceful and harmonious state, everything will operate harmoniously by itself, instead of saying that it will operate only if you do this or that. It is already operating. You don't throw this or that into it to obstruct it. Imagine that your body is like a gear that is operating harmoniously by itself. Then today you say this is particularly good for the body, and you throw it into that gear, throwing a stone into it. 
Oh dear, this diamond is particularly good. A diamond was thrown in, and your gear got stuck and wouldn't rotate. Do you understand? It wouldn't rotate. The machine stopped. You all just replaced various parts, did all kinds of this and that. But in fact, you only need to take out those few stones stuck in the gear and it will operate automatically again. 

**Question:** Then what should I do?
**Higher Spirit:**It's harmony and balance. Just take out the stones stuck in the gear and keep picking them out to make it reach a state of harmonious operation.

**Question:**Would finding a doctor with excellent medical skills be helpful?
**Higher Spirit:**What is medical skill? I just told you. Your treatment, your salvation is the way you recover. That is, you yourself are a normally, perfectly, and harmoniously operating gear. You just need to take out the stone stuck inside. It's not that you are bad. We need to fix and not impose something on it. Just as I said earlier, you are immersed in classifying and defining which is good and which is not good. We don't want that. We don't want this or that. This is good and I want this. Take all the good ones. Do you understand what I mean? This state will blind your eyes. Why does it only pick and choose in its own world? You can't see the true beauty of life.

**Question:**Then what causes this state of mine?
**Higher Spirit:** How is this cause formed? This is your collective consciousness. You humans all have this... Because when you choose this physical body to come to this world, you also choose the karma that this world has. Just like this, the world currently has one, that is, the default way of operation. Join them. The world operates this way. They have these concepts. For example, if you fall into a stinky water tank, no matter what, your body will be stained with their stinky water, right? What I just said earlier were all part of a cleaning process. You will discover step by step in your life: I was categorizing again just now. That thought I just had was something again. I don't need to deny myself. I don't need to hold myself back. Understand? Thoughts are not you. It's like a cloud floating past your eyes. It will pass by unless you are intimidated by it, that is, you are afraid, or something like that. Then it will affect you. It has no power in itself. Imagine all your thoughts or ideas or anything. It's just some false ones floating in front of your eyes, like an animal, a fake animal. Only you have the power to make this animal come alive to scare you and affect you, understand? The power to make it come alive is given by you. Then it feeds on fear. Worry and fear are its food. You give it, and it comes alive and then comes to play the adversary with you, understand? When you stop feeding it, it dies. It has no power at all.

**Question:**Will I recover from my illness after a month?
**Higher Spirit:** There is no future. There is no future here. You only have the present, you only have the moment, only the present. There is no future. Because the state in front of you, that is, your current state determines your experience. Where you can experience is also determined by your present state. For instance, if your current state is suddenly like having a sudden enlightenment, just like there is a saying that one can become a Buddha instantly. That is, you suddenly have let go of everything, and then you enter that state. That state is like a channel, and then you will continuously experience this. If your current state is very painful and you keep wanting to break free from this state, that is a state. Then you will continuously create such a state experience. Then tell me where the future is. It's just that each present state of yours creates where you will continue to stay.
For example, when we turn to the next page, what you will turn to on the next page is determined by this moment now. Just now, what I said, those two states are different pages. Do you understand my meaning? Because in the future you mentioned, it's like, OK, I'm not feeling well today. Then maybe I'll be fine after a month. But if you keep flipping the same page and create such a state, after a month, it'll still be the same and won't get better. It's not that time can't change anything, but it's your own state. So every present moment, and your current present moment determines what you experience in the next present moment. Is that so?

**Question:**I still don't quite understand.
**Higher Spirit:**It doesn't matter. You can take this recording back and listen to it repeatedly. Then in your life, as long as you don't strictly demand of yourself, understand? Don't be strict and treat yourself like a prisoner, constantly keeping an eye on what you haven't done right. Just think about it. If a person is in such a situation, can he relax? Can he truly present his true self? He is constantly being monitored. Understand that he feels the need to present a perfect person?

**Question:**Then, may I ask if I need to remain in such a state?
**Higher Spirit:** You don't need to maintain anything. You don't need to do anything. I'm telling you now what you don't need to do, understand? There isn't any "how you should do it to be right" here. The "how you should do it to be right" is for you to let go of this thought. When you are talking about holding the mind in something, maintaining something, you yourself, just like what I said earlier, your such unconscious behavior, your such compulsive behavior. You must do something. Life just exists. You look at the flower. Does it have to, like I must run and run everywhere, run to show my color and my fragrance to someone? Do I have to send my fragrance to others? Think about it. If the plants in your world or the animals have the same ideas as you humans, what would the world become? The lion would say I have to run in front of humans to show them my strength so that I have value. Understand?
You yourself are operating perfectly. You don't need to learn any concepts or any methods.

**Question:**Is it to live happily? 
**Higher Spirit:** It's not about living happily just because you consider it merely as a goal. Again, you view it as, ah, life should be happy. Why aren't you happy? You aren't really living. You shouldn't be like this. Why am I not happy? Why do I have such thoughts? Living things are always ever-changing, all kinds of colors. It's not only black and white. It's colorful, vivid and splendid. It's all kinds. It can cry, it can laugh, it can be crazy, it can be insane. It can be all kinds as long as it's real and presented by you, not limited to the way it shows. When you force it to show only in a happy way, happiness is just a state shown by others, but you take it as a pursuit. 
You suppress your pain and ignore your pain. Originally, you should cry, but you force yourself to smile. Isn't this crazy? Everything is up to you. Do you understand?
Do you have any more questions?

**Question:**Then what should I do to be right?
**Higher Spirit:** No matter what you do, it's right. I'll give you a mantra: I am God. I'm right in everything. Don't listen to what others say. Only you yourself know what you want. Only you yourself know which posture is the most comfortable for you. Put yourself in the most comfortable state.


## 2021/10/18 - What should I do if I don't like the experience in the material world I'm in?

**Higher Spirit:** Hello everyone. What questions do you have? You can ask. 
**Question:**I want to know how I can become smooth.
**Higher Spirit:** What's your name? 

**Question:**XX 
**Higher Spirit:** XX, I'll link your energy. Do you want to know how to change your current unfavorable state?
Do you know what a smooth state is? Are there such people around you? You should know that among your humans, for example, among your humans, you know many like Buddha, who have no jobs, no income, and no such state. Is it not good in your eyes? Do they have to get out of that state? If you carefully understand the thoughts in your mind, if what you really pursue in life as you say, that is, the situation you are currently encountering leads to your dissatisfaction, and the goodness you pursue is good, you will find that this doesn't make sense. Just like I tell you that Buddha has no job, income, savings, or any material... Is that person the worst one and should become as good as you say? So the problem isn't about which is good or bad. The problem lies in your definition of them in your mind. Because these definitions will cause you to have a lot of internal conflicts. If you have internal conflicts, think about it. If you were a car and all the parts inside were in conflict, then that car couldn't stay together. It couldn't be stable. It would be a broken-down car. How could it operate? Do you understand what I mean? It couldn't start. It couldn't operate. So if you can't operate, you definitely can't create value in the material world. You can't create value and you definitely can't produce some material results. Do you understand this principle? If you don't understand, you can listen to this message several times repeatedly. Then carefully ponder again exactly what you are trapped by. What traps you is not the external material world. It's the definitions in your own mind, the things you want, pursue, and a conflict between your own definition of your state. That is, it doesn't allow you to function well. When you aren't functioning well, you will encounter what you said - you can't find your value, can't realize your value, and can't enjoy the results. So you need to redefine life, what is good and what is not good. Because each of you already has everything good, but you think that is garbage. Do you understand? All the most precious things you already have. 

(The first disconnection) **Higher Spirit:** You can ask questions now. 
**Question:** How can one enter the meditative state quickly?

**Higher Spirit:** Do you want to know how to enter the meditative state quickly? Just now, this psychic lady entered this state through breathing. Do you want to know how it works? It's like you want to ask how electricity works. You just need to understand because you can do it through this. But I tell you that many of you don't need to do it this way. So this is not the only way. This is only effective for some people, not for all. But ultimately, what is your purpose? It is to let go of your trapped mind, that is, to prevent you from being disturbed too much by the outside. When you are not disturbed too much by the outside, you can focus and you can explore, just like a signal.
 So and what you traditionally call that kind of meditation or something, because some people are very averse to meditating like this. Of course, meditation is generally very good for many, many people, that is, you can enter that kind of state. And some people, they like traveling. For example, when they go to a particularly beautiful environment, with mountains and water, and in such an environment, they can enter that kind of state. So you need to follow your own inner voice because your inner self contains everything that guides you, and you will find the kind of feeling you want to explore. This is not a destination, nor is it a goal, nor is it a result trained in a certain way. This is more like a state of letting go. You might think that to reach a certain state, you need to work from nine to five every day, follow a fixed schedule, and so on. Then from this girl's information database, I retrieved a piece of information she saw, which was about a person who achieved enlightenment and shared that he used to run for several hours a day, meditate for several hours, and accomplished many things that others couldn't. What he pursued was enlightenment, but it didn't happen until the moment he let go. Then he never did any of the previous practices like meditating for several hours or running for several hours, or any of those ascetic-like efforts. Do you understand what I mean? When you let go of all pursuits, any pursuits, at the present moment, every step you take will have the gift you are seeking. Every step is a surprise. Every step is like a footprint. That footprint leads you to where you want to go. That path is unique to you. No one can guide you because their path is unique to them. Each of you is not following in the footsteps of others because you have a big misunderstanding that if that person is very successful, I should learn from him because he is a successful person and we should learn from him. His success is unique to him. Why do you have to imitate, or follow suit, or think that only his method is successful? No. He has only himself, and even if his path is a self-destructive one, it is what he wants to experience and is considered success for him.
It's not like what people in the material world think, as in the previous question just now: How much money should I have, how many properties in the material sense, how much fame should I have. These are not success. Success means that in this material world, you have experienced what you wanted to experience, gone where you wanted to go, met the people you wanted to meet, resolved the grievances between you and that person, and broken through the restraints you imposed on yourself. This is success. This is the success that each of you needs to understand. That success might mean that you have been in prison for 50 years, but your heart is extremely peaceful. Every moment you feel that you are in the grace of the Creator. This state is also success, do you understand? But in your material eyes, what is this? This is not success; this is a failed life.
Because success does not lie in where your body is or what you experience, but rather in the internal state you are experiencing. The state it creates. If
A person with a high level of consciousness, even if he is in prison, his thoughts and his consciousness can influence the entire humanity. So your connection with us to receive this information is mainly to make you see clearly that you are not just your body. And not to say that you should not be deeply trapped in the collective consciousness. No longer be deeply trapped in the collective consciousness. Because your collective consciousness has many, many such deeply rooted concepts, and then those cognitions, some beliefs. These make the range of activities available to you very small. The best thing about life is that you can continuously expand your range of activities. Maybe before, your range of activities was only one square meter. As your consciousness keeps improving, it reaches 10 square meters, it reaches 100, 1000, 10,000, and then infinitely, infinitely, infinitely. Then why is the allure of rich people so great for you? That is to say, you all worship rich people relatively.
I tell you that the biggest and greatest thing that rich people have and that you should learn from is that they have fewer restrictions than you. Although they have restrictions, the restrictions will be much fewer than those of people without money. Why? Because even if he is penniless himself, he can utilize what he has now. What he has now may be a very good talent. He may have very good relationships. He may be very capable of convincing people. He can raise tens of millions with just these few points. Then, he uses the tens of millions to create hundreds of millions. Then, he uses the hundreds of millions to create billions, tens of billions, hundreds of billions. Do you understand what I mean? It's not that they have more than you from birth. But they know how to use their currently limited resources to create infinitely. And in this process, his consciousness is constantly, constantly, constantly... So this is what you should pay attention to regarding the previous issue.
She is limited in the material world by those definitions, those concepts, and those ideas in her mind. You already have a tool with which you can create everything. That is your thoughts, your consciousness, and your energy. 
All your tools are available to you. Do you still have any questions?

**Question:**I want to know what my soul is experiencing in this life.
**Higher Spirit:** You want to know what your soul is experiencing in this life. What's your name? 
**Question:**My name is XXX.
**Higher Spirit:** I'll link with XXX. You have chosen this life to clear some restrictive beliefs for you and also some of the fears within you. Then that fear is a kind of fear for survival, such as a sense of security. And that kind is... A sense of security is manifested in many aspects, such as a sense of security in belonging, a sense of security in relationships, and a sense of security in materials. It's all kinds of senses of security. You will experience this before for you to break through, all the breakthroughs. That is to say, you will bring these issues to the surface again to give you another chance to benefit from them anew.
Just obtain the exercise you want from it.
This is your individual situation. It's your soul that chose this physical body and this life to help you break through certain things at a higher level. Keep asking, and your questions will draw out your information. 
**Question:**How can I get along with my children?
**Higher Spirit:**How should you get along with your children? So, are you encountering obstacles in getting along with your children? Let me connect to the most troubling aspect. What is the relationship between you and your children that makes you feel troubled?

**Higher Spirit:**Let me sense it first. Let me sense this relationship. Why did your child choose such an environment? Your child chose such a family for a reason. Between you and your child, you are what is called soulmates, meaning you have many strong connections. The connections are not just for this life but for many, many lifetimes. You both have very close relationships and connections. In this life, your child comes with you, and both of you assist each other in breaking through. That is, both of you assist each other in breaking through some issues that you want to overcome. And those breakthroughs include how you two can better establish that sense of connection in the material world together. Because as mentioned before, you need to, that is, you have some insecurities that have manifested and need to be overcome. So does he. That is to say, you two need to, just like you two are like duckweed, the kind of duckweed floating on the water surface, and then it's this feeling of no light. Then both of you need to take root deeply, and taking root is a process, a gradually taking root process. Then you are his mother. So if you don't take root well, you will affect him to be in a state of not taking root either. So the best help you can offer him is that you need to take root. You do your own homework first. Then because that kind of inner sense of security, connection, and the feeling of taking root within you will be directly passed on to him, making him more powerful to show vitality, strength, that kind of strength, passion, and vigor, and to show it more powerfully. So it's not to force him or change him. Rather, it means you can understand him, just as I can understand your feelings, child, because sometimes I have the same feeling too because many, many of you humans have such feelings, not just you, understand? Because many of them here are the same as you, but you are better at expressing this kind of yourself through many other forms, that is, not directly expressed, but many of them, even some violent behaviors, destructive behaviors, that's because they have a feeling of being frantic, a feeling of being out of control, a feeling of insecurity. 


**Question:** Then six months later
**Higher Spirit:**Why is it the next six months? 
**Question:** Then recently?
**Higher Spirit:**First of all, you have a misunderstanding, that is, a misunderstanding of this time. Imagine for a moment that everything you experience in your material world is a frequency of yours, or a state of your consciousness, your frequency, your vibration frequency. OK, now your vibration frequency is 50, right? If it's 50, you can only explore everything within the range of 50. That is to say, if your frequency has always been around 50, then whether it's the next six months or six years, you are just experiencing 50 in different ways. It's still 50. It just changes. You feel as if you have changed an environment, changed some people, changed some objects. It's like changing a stage and changing some props, but you are performing the same play.
The sense of powerlessness you feel, or the sense of insecurity or the sense of restraint or the inner struggle is the same. Do you understand what I mean? Just changing a scene, or changing a... Just people getting old, or the object changing. Your experience is still the same because it's like your computer program. Before you haven't upgraded, your speed can only be so fast. You can't exceed your program. You said your program's maximum is 1000, you can't exceed 1000. Only after you upgrade can you reach 5000. Do you understand this meaning? Then what is upgrading? Upgrading means that you are awake, you have awareness, you consciously know that from the present moment, because every present moment, every present moment you all have gifts. You received your gift in the present moment. That gift is to help you unlock and upgrade. Then after you receive this gift, you can continue to upgrade next.  and  and You think it's real. You think you're opposed to it. That is, you are you, and it is it. You are passive. But that's just a mirror. That just projects yourself. For example, your perception of the world. How do you perceive this world? Do you think this world is evil or paradise? Because these are what you experience. What you experience is to tell you what program you are currently using that is running, operating, functioning. So when you can clearly understand this layer of relationship, you will be able to very well experience what you want to experience in the material world, instead of experiencing passively, instead of experiencing your collective consciousness, that is, your so-called karma, your collective karma, the karma of all of humanity. You won't continue to be polluted in this huge dye vat, understand? Just like your Earth is like a cesspool. In the cesspool, there are all kinds of feces pulled by various people. You have no choice when you are in it. You have to passively inhale those smells and be polluted and influenced. You have no choice. But now I'm telling you how to jump out of the cesspool, that is, how to turn the cesspool into something as wonderful as the underwater world. Because when you think about it, you are like a car. If you don't actively drive and let other people's cars push you along, being pushed along in the crowd, you are influenced by them. If they go to hell, you will also go to hell. Do you still have any questions?

**Question:****Higher Spirit:** Roughly speaking, don't take "you know" as a time to plan your life or target. All your gifts are right in front of you. You can see everything from right in front of you. Your gifts are right in front of you. Once you get this gift, you will keep getting gifts. This is a positive process. This is a process that keeps getting happier and easier.

**Question:**What should I do to become a psychic channel?
**Higher Spirit:** How to become a psychic channel. If this is you, because each of your souls chose this physical body to come to this world for the experiences you wanted to have. If this was the experience you chose at the beginning, you will move towards this experience. Do you understand what I mean? You said, but if it's from other aspects. You mean how to become a psychic channel is to constantly keep trusting yourself. 
It's just two words - trust. Because if you don't trust, you can't do the psychic work. Your mind will constantly tell you that this is unreasonable, that you are so disgraceful, that you are wrong for saying this. Others say you are talking nonsense. What are you doing? Are you crazy? If your mind is always in such a state, where you don't allow or you don't trust, in a state of fear, you can't achieve a psychic connection. What is psychic connection? It means you are completely, even if you have to kneel down and bark like a dog now, understand? You follow that impulse and kneel down to bark immediately. Why don't you stop it? You don't think this is disgraceful. That is, you can allow that energy to go in any direction it wants without using a perspective or definition from your material world to hold it back...
This kind of statement is too low, or it's too meaningless, or it's too stupid... There's no interference. It's just a psychic phenomenon. And the most you humans do is interfere with yourselves, interfere with everything because your minds always listen to others. This is good because it seems like you want to make everyone the same, equally noble, equally beautiful, equally but you should be colorful, each different. Everyone is unique and it's because of your uniqueness that makes life so colorful and diverse. So allow your own uniqueness. Don't follow anyone's path and don't follow your mind either because what's in your mind All are just some implanted, that is, whatever others implant into you, some concepts, beliefs that you unconsciously accept in your subconscious. Your collective consciousness and such things won't allow you to have any breakthroughs. They won't allow you to have any. That is, they are just your constraints. When you let go of your mind, completely let go of your mind, what is the real you like? For example, if your seed is a rose, your rose will bloom. If your seed is a barley, your barley will bloom. It's not that barley is more filling, barley is more valuable and roses are not valuable. Do you understand what I mean? But let each of you... Because each of your seeds is different, then some seeds need to be in water to grow. Are some of them in the ground? Are some of them in the cracks of stones? So they are different. Some need deserts. You are all different. So each of your paths is unique, distinctive and dazzling. Then all your information is already included in it. So the only master who can guide you is not someone else or us. It's yourself. Any questions?

**Question:**Then how can I reduce the interference of my mind?
**Higher Spirit:**How to reduce the interference of your mind? Your mind, first of all, don't treat it as, how to say, like an enemy. Your mind is very smart. It will only choose things that are meaningful to you and that you think will be effective before it will do them. So when you are doing some, that is, when you are doing certain things, when you are doing some things, you must think that doing these things will bring you some benefits. It will make you increase your sense of security. Will it make you understand what I mean? If you no longer have that kind of need for security within yourself, that is, you understand that you are an eternal existence. You have died thousands and tens of thousands of times. You are an eternal existence. Do you understand that you have everything and that everything in the universe is for your use? Understand? You have the energy to control it. If you can understand some deep things about life, the mind will naturally not grasp these small ones. So you can be very good. It's like jointly creating. You only because... The mind is here to help you. It wants to protect you from being bullied, protect you from being injured, and protect you from being destroyed. Understand? It has this kind of... So you only have to make you all be able to be good partners. That is to say, if you understand that you won't get hurt no matter what, because being hurt is just a definition you give yourself. Understand? How to put it? The mind is neutral. What really affects you is what you truly believe and whether you know who you are. Because for the same person, if he knows that he is the eternal existence, he is the Creator, he is everything. His mind and one me, this flesh of mine only has a few decades in this life. Do you think the reactions produced by their minds will be the same? So the real problem is not how you deal with the mind but that you understand who you are. The mind will not always hold on to something the same. This is a process. This is a process for you to explore life. It's very beautiful. Any questions? (Second disconnection)

## 2021/10/18 - Be brave to be yourself

**Higher Spirit:**Ask your questions. What's the question? 
**Question:** I want to know why I am so sensitive to the outside world.
**Higher Spirit:**You just want to know why you are so sensitive to the outside world, right? Let me feel your energy first. First of all, I want you to have an understanding of that kind of sensitive constitution. I want to tell you that your kind of strong and sensitive feeling, and then this is your talent. Let's just say that, it's like you are a caterpillar and then some people are crabs. Crabs have thick shells, and they are naturally not so sensitive. Then your caterpillar, when someone touches you, you curl up, right? So this is one of your characteristics But all your characteristics are unique to you, and they are also your advantages. Then I want you to understand yourself better because each of you is unique. You are different from others. Maybe others have no reaction no matter how they are abused, but you might have a reaction when others' words are a bit harsher. Why is that? It's because you yourself are a sensitive constitution. A sensitive constitution is a kind of... But this is your advantage. Why? Because of your strong sensitivity, just like a dog. Its nose is particularly sensitive and it can smell all the scents that no one else can smell. So it can use this to do some work of finding things for you humans. So your body also requires a process for you to understand and know it, and then to make it positively serve you. But that is to say, your sensitivity, behind which there are some negative definitions that cause you to get hurt rather than your sensitivity itself causing you to get hurt. For instance, let me tell you this. If you were a caterpillar and someone touched you, and then you got frightened and curled up, you think you were hurt and disturbed.
But that touch, they would be like, wow, this is a child. That caterpillar is so cute. He wants to touch you. Do you understand what I mean? If you consider it as this child likes me very much and he wants to stroke me. Stroking is an expression of love. He is expressing his love to me. Accept his love. When you accept this stroking in such a state, what it brings to you is love instead of that kind of fright. Do you understand? So the main thing is that you need to establish your own sense of security. First, you have to know who you are. If you know who you are and won't break just because someone touches you, then you don't have to worry about their touch. They are just here to express love to you. Keep asking.

**Question:****Higher Spirit:** Because you humans are always asking you to endure and adapt to this world, do you understand what I mean? Instead of saying that you find one that suits you, because you will have a kind of fear of survival or a pursuit of money that will cause you to endure something you can't endure. For example, if you yourself are a caterpillar, you should be on a tree, but then you say that those fish are swimming well in the water. 
I threw myself into the water. Why couldn't I swim as well as a fish?

**Question:**I don't quite understand what it means.
**Higher Spirit:** The meaning is whether you have recognized yourself, whether you know exactly what suits you and where you should be. 
**Question:**I want to know whether I should choose this job or not. Whether this job suits me or not.
**Higher Spirit:** Whether it suits or not, there are two aspects first. That is, in your current energy state, are you suitable for this job and capable of doing it? But you can just project yourself into something that you can be suitable for and want to be suitable for. But will this conflict with what you want to experience in this life that you have come for? So it comes back to the previous information, that is, you need to know yourself.
Because you humans always solve survival problems first, that is, put survival problems first instead of saying I understand who I am, I know who I am. I am a tiger. I am suitable in the forest. My ability is this. You don't understand yourselves. You just deal with a survival problem. So many conflicts and many problems arise for you to solve. If you can, that is, step by step, understand who you are and what you really love.
Then when you are doing what you love, your survival problems, all problems, and other problems will be solved. But you have an inner fear because you dare not let go. If I tell you that you will fly if you let go, you won't believe it. None of you will let go. You will hold on tightly. Here, there is no such thing as suitability. The only suitable thing is that you explore your own path, grope your way, and find the position that suits you by yourself. Because each of you is different. Each of you came into this world with different experiences. Because when you truly live your own life, it doesn't matter where you are. When you don't live your own life, it's a problem wherever you are. So your question is not whether you are suitable for this job or whether you should choose this job. Instead, it's about how you can achieve a balanced state. To get you on your track instead of the forced one. Because when you develop in these two directions, all your information now, it's like your information will bring out a bunch of information. Those pieces of information about you will only be generated when you ask for them. If you don't ask, they won't be generated. You will only get answers to those questions related to what you ask. If you keep focusing on other questions instead of those about yourself personally, you won't obtain useful information for you. (Break) **Higher Spirit:**Just ask. What's your question?

**Question:**I want to know what restrictions I have at work.
**Higher Spirit:**What are the restrictions at work for you? You should know that it's not the work that brings restrictions to you but yourself within. These are some within you instead of external ones. Everything external is just an illusion. The illusion can't restrict you.

**Question:**Then what do I need to break through within myself?
**Higher Spirit:**What do you need to break through within? 
I'll connect and sense your energy field. I sense that you are like an ant on a hot pan. There's a kind of bewilderment but can't stop. Then your kind of tense and anxious energy, and there is no direction but must keep moving, that kind of forced state. You say that the ant on the hot pan appears in such a state because the pan is hot, understand? Then if its pan is cold? That is, if it's cold? Then it doesn't need to be like this. That is, if the pan is just neutral, but who is adding fire underneath?

**Question:**Then why am I like this?
**Higher Spirit:**Do you now want to find the reason? Do you want to know how not to have such a state? OK, I'll help you take a look. Do you want to know how your energy state is...
Why did you choose such courses to experience? Why did you choose such a state to experience in this life? You don't need to speak. I'm connecting now. It's like I'm typing on the computer now. I need to input your words and extract the information. So don't speak. You only need to allow me to connect with you now. You seem to be bound at present. You want to know how to get out of this binding force. Let me see. You are walking in the wrong direction now because you didn't choose... Just imagine that your water flow is in the front, but you keep going backward, so it gives you a feeling of effort and consumption.
That's because you yourself don't have the courage. That's because you yourself lack courage internally. So this is related to a soul in your present life as the theme. You want to break through. You want to make yourself brave. So you put as if many things, all things are pressing on you and force you to face them, forcing you to stimulate your courage. So a theme you explore in this life and a point you need to break through is to regain your courage. That courage means you have the courage to show yourself. You have the courage. Continue. In what aspect is it? You can stimulate your inner fear through these ways. First of all, it is family relations. Then in family relations, you have the courage to live yourself out. This is the lesson you need to face. Then in your work, you have the courage to live and show yourself. This is another point. Then in society, you have the courage to show yourself. This is yet another point.
So no matter what or what, the important thing is that throughout your entire identity, you have the courage to show your true inner self... For example, your boss comes to tell you something that is very unreasonable. And you clearly know how this matter should be handled. Then you have the courage to do it, as if in front of the national leader. Do you understand? That is, in front of authority, in front of those who make you feel very authoritative. That is, you think they are experts and you are nothing. But there is a voice inside you telling you that you need to stand up and say this. In this way, they are all experts, authoritative, and famous people. You are nothing, but you can stand up and say that what you all said is wrong. I want to share my thoughts, and then show your thoughts. This is courage. Do you understand? Also, for example, among your parents, they are your parents, but they have made some very inhumane demands on you. You think that if you show some of your true thoughts, others will scold you for being unfilial. But if you have the courage to tell your parents and stand up and say that this behavior of yours is offending me, and you don't care how others view you. You have the courage to show your true inner thoughts and share your thoughts. So this courage will make you face that you may need to challenge some authorities, challenge some traditional thoughts, challenge the eyes of society, and challenge your inner distrust of yourself. 

**Question:**Am I overly sensitive because of this?
**Higher Spirit:**Yes, because you haven't allowed this energy to be released. You just felt uncomfortable inside and this energy has been suppressed for a long time, resulting in such a state. It's like why ants on a hot pan. Because the ant's body is too small and it has no way to release that heat. Do you understand what I mean? It can't bear that energy, but that energy is very powerful. So, you have chosen this and need to allow yourself to have powerful energy to release you. It's like you are at this critical moment to take a weapon and that weapon is courage. This is what you need to face and breakthrough in your life. 

**Question:**So I need to grow through these obstacles.
**Higher Spirit:**Yes, this is also an obstacle you set for yourself. It is to stimulate your inner courage. So as I just said, it needs to be manifested through several relationships, such as family relationships, social relationships, and the relationship with your boss at work. These are all... It seems like they are weighing you down so much that you have to burst out with that energy. And when that energy bursts out, everything will be smooth. Do you understand?

**Higher Spirit:**If you don't choose to show your true self because you are afraid of something. You are afraid that showing yourself will affect something. For example, you think it will cause you to lose your job, or be laughed at by others. For example, your reputation will be bad, be criticized by others, affect your marriage, get divorced, and have no sense of security. So you will gradually look from your own thoughts to see exactly what thoughts have restricted you. Do you have any other questions? Because your information has been downloaded to her and she can help you... 
**Question:**I want to ask what kind of soul relationship I have with my child.
**Higher Spirit:**What is the relationship between you and your child? Let me take a look. Your child is here to assist you in breaking through, do you understand? For example, with your child, let's say you want to obtain your courage, right? Your child is like, "Mom, come on! I give you strength. I give you love. You will definitely obtain that courage." It's like such a relationship with you. So he will be like oil for you. He will be your motivation. Then when you gain the courage, you illuminate... He will also... For example, when you get the light or the flashlight, you will also illuminate him. So you have such a relationship that he is your driving force for you to obtain this. After obtaining this, he will benefit. He is the beneficiary. So you belong to this kind of relationship with each other.


**Question:**Why do I always lose my temper with my child?
**Higher Spirit:** You lose your temper not because of him, but because you yourself are in an unstable state. So it's not because of him, but because you yourself are in an unstable state and want to find a point to break through and vent. That point could be your subordinate employees. Just like you say, why do I always lose my temper with my subordinate employees? When he asks me a question, I lose my temper with him. 
**Question:****Higher Spirit:** That also has to do with you being in an unstable state. Just like, for example, if an engine is unstable, it will present many problems, such as spraying water, making noise, and... parts breaking down, right? There will be many. So all these series of problems in your life ultimately come down to the fact that you are not in a stable state. Why do you still need to have a weapon that belongs to you, as if that can make you complete? It's your courage. You will spend your entire life to break through. This is not a day or two; this is a process, bit by bit, a process bit by bit. So don't rush. Because making you slow down and not rush is also one of your tasks. This is also a point you need to break through. Is there still any question? Yes, seize your courage. Because if you seize your courage, it's like you finally become yourself, finally can bear fruit, and then everything else will be fine. Then, as just said, slow down. I'll download your information to her.


## 2021/10/25 - The Book of Death

**Higher Spirit:**You ask. Any questions?

**Question:**We want to ask about human's fear of death. How should we face and handle this fear of death?
**Higher Spirit:**Wait a moment. Your first question is that you humans have a lot of fear of death. Then how to face and handle it? First of all, you don't only have fear of death. It's for anything unknown to you, that is, anything you don't understand. For example, many people have fear of darkness because they don't know what's in the darkness. It's that kind of unknown... If you turn on the light, you can see everything in the darkness clearly, then you won't (be afraid) So it is your fear that arises from a lack of understanding and the unknown. If you could see everything clearly, then that kind of fear would disappear. That's why you all like the familiar and the known because that can bring you a kind of sense of control and security. This is something you are familiar with. So when we help you to know and understand death, it will help you reduce that kind of fear. Because each individual is different. Even if you understand it clearly, he still has his own fear. So that is to say, at most, it can help you reduce that kind of fear. Then among you humans, many of you, many souls have chosen to briefly experience the process of death, as if running into that dark room to take a look and then come back to tell you what's inside. There are already many such people who have had such an experience, and they also help reduce that kind of fear of the unknown. Because that is to say, I'll run into this dark room to feel and experience it first, and then tell you what's inside. Then if you know, when you face it, you might not have such a big shock. So there are already many such ones to help you. Then next, we will also help you to understand and know more. Then if there's anything you want to ask, you can ask. Because the more questions you have, the more information you bring out. You keep asking.

**Question:**Then the next question is about death. How should a person with a terminal illness face it?
**Higher Spirit:**A person with a terminal illness, that is, he is told how much time his body has left... First of all, there is a misunderstanding here. That is, because doctors in your material world will determine your time based on a surface symptom of yours, but this is a wrong key. This is a wrong concept. This is a mistake. It is only when all of you agree to this phenomenon that it will occur. That is to say, for example, a doctor tells you that there are only three months left. Only if you believe him, agree with him, and support what he says as the truth, will you experience only three months. Because in your material world, you have seen many people. Doctors said there were only three months left, but in the end they lived for another thirty years. There are such things. This is that they don't choose to believe the information given by those others, or the so-called authoritative information you call. The most important point you should pay attention to is about yourselves.
You don't hand over your lives to anyone to tell you what will happen to you. Whether it's a doctor, a fortune teller, or other authoritative figures. Because none of them, none of them, no matter who they are, not even some things we tell you are certain or absolute. Then it's you yourself who controls that. First of all, you have to understand this level, that is, how exactly this operates. If it's like your own body, if your consciousness, just like you are a machine, and you have no idea at all about what functions this machine has and how it operates, right? Then you won't be able to exert its inherent functions at will. So when we convey information to you here, we need to make you understand the most important point, that is, no one can control you or predict or determine anything about you.

So the doctor will base on a superficial symptom of yours, but all those superficial symptoms only reflect a pattern of operation you once had, that is, your current, your old operation mode, your beliefs, and your state. It presents, OK. For example, you have been operating with this concept in the previous days, right? OK. Then your body shows this conflict, this obstacle, this problem before you. But when you realize that it is some states within you, a personal state of yours, it makes your physical health present this state. When you realize it, then you can immediately reselect an operation mode at the moment, that is, select another state. That state is like a vibration frequency as you said. OK. I was too fast before. I felt that my bones were going to fall apart because it was too fast and overloaded. Then when you operate too fast, well, now I want to slow it down. Put it in a moderate state at that moment. Slowly and gradually, your body that was about to fall apart will immediately return to a normal state. You should know that your body is like a mighty army and everything... It listens to you, the commander. Do you understand?
So your commander is running, rushing, under great pressure, and in pain. If that's the case, they will show such a state. When you tell each of them that you are safe and we are operating in a happy, passionate, and harmonious state, they will also show you such a state. So the external manifestations are just to make you clear and understand, just to make you see that you need to make a new choice instead of saying that you will continue in this state. Unless you are unconscious, that is, you can't find a way out. You don't know where the way out is. You are entrusting your hope, that is, to doctors, that is, to others. You still let others control your state. In such a situation, you will follow whatever they think. So this is about, that is, this point that each of you needs to understand.
Then if you understand, that is to say, how do people who are judged, that is, diagnosed with terminal illnesses face death, right? First, you know that the manifestation of the terminal illness in your body is not fixed. It is not fixed. It can, at the moment when you change your mind, your body starts anew because your body is more powerful than any medicine and any doctor. It is the most intelligent and has the most repair and healing functions. So this point, that is to say, even if the doctor tells you that you have a terminal illness, then at that moment, you can take it as a reminder that you need to change your inner state. Your inner state, for example, before you were vibrating at 1,000 times per minute because of anxiety, worry, and all kinds of panic, making your heart pound rapidly. Now it's to let you know that your machine is almost falling apart. When you decide, that is to say, and then you say that I want to find a way out now, I want to make myself like this or that.
At the moment of your mental transformation, your body starts to self-repair. At that moment, it starts to self-repair. So this is it. It's up to you to decide, not the doctor, nor the external factors. Only if you trust the doctors will you experience a state as they said.

**Question:**Then how should we face and accept that the relatives around us are about to face death?
**Higher Spirit:**How to face the relatives around... Just as you should always think that, OK, this relative is very healthy and should have no problem. He will live until... That is to say, you should always be ready in your heart that you are about to lose your relative instead of really waiting until you lose him, and... Because death is not like what you say, that is, a physical death. It is not necessarily that one will die when they are old or when they are sick. It can be sudden... But you don't know the arrangement of your relative around you, the arrangement he gives himself. How is he... So it can happen very suddenly. That is, you suddenly, you may never have thought about it well or been prepared. In that case, you won't have time to have a really good farewell with them.
So you should treat your precious people, that is, your precious people, as if they could leave this body at any moment. Face them with such a mentality. Because when you start to know that death doesn't only occur when one is old or sick, that is to say, it can be very sudden. Then when you look at this person, and you know in your mind that today might be the last time I see him. If you have such a thought, your attitude towards him will change. You will change. You won't insist on quarreling with him over a little thing, understand? If you knew that this person's time was up tomorrow, would you still quarrel with him until you were red in the face? Would you still have an argument with him? When you know that from tomorrow on you will never see this person again, would you completely let go of all the resentment or whatever, the complex emotions you have towards the other person in your heart?
So what you need to learn is not to wait until your precious person, when he is really facing, that is... Because this kind of probability is very small, that is to say, really living to a certain age, or getting sick, it can give you a slow one.
The process like this belongs to the minority. For many of you, many deaths are sudden, then you will find that you have lost the chance to say goodbye to him.  and  **Higher Spirit:** Regarding the dying stage of a loved one, OK, for example, this loved one is already very old and lying in bed, already knowing that his time is running out. At this time, what can you do? First of all, you can't give others what you don't have yourself. So you can only say that if you are currently learning about death, you can share what we will learn next with him. Then, for example, if you haven't studied yet, you can tell the other party that the other party can bring you in and let you learn to face death. Then you can learn about death together with him because only when you, OK, it's like every door. You can only discover what's inside after you want to enter this door and go in. If you don't go in, you won't be able to discover it inside. So you need to have a desire, that is, you want to explore. Then exploration is like the two of you holding hands and exploring together. So in this process, you can hold hands with him and explore about death. Then after you have this thought in your heart, all the subsequent information will be provided to you. That is, you send out a longing, a desire, and then you want to understand about death. Then you will experience it. In the material world, you might see a news report or some TV shows or some movies, and it will synchronously bring this information into your life. So when those around you, when they are willing to explore with him, it is also when you are accompanying him. Both of you will gain. That is, both of you will from this journey, that is, enter this door and see what's inside. You will both gain. So it still depends on, that is to say, what you want to bring to the other party.
Because for you, there is no, that is to say, there is no any one way, that is to say, you must do this. Each of you is a creator, an innovator. That is, you are an inventor. You can use some of your own inner things that you want to create... For example, if you want to show your love for life to the other party. For example, if you especially like dancing, then you can take him to dance crazily outside. This is also a way. I'm just giving an example. If you especially like traveling and seeing beautiful scenery, then you can urge him to see the beautiful scenery. Because this is the gift you gave him. First of all, you wanted to give him a gift. Before you left, I wanted to give you a gift. I wanted you to experience my perception of life through me. I think life... For example, delicacies are especially wonderful. For me, then I can share a lot of the delicacies I made with you.
So you can according to your own, that is, what gift you want to give to the other party, choose what gift, and then give it to the other party. And on this road, forever and ever, that is, when you have the kind of desire to give the other party a gift, it is always beneficial for both of you. It's not only that he can benefit from it, but you too. Just like what you are doing now, you want to give, to other people, give them wisdom, give them a broader perspective to view everything. But when you are giving, in the process of wanting to give, you yourselves benefit first, understand? It's like you want to pick a flower in the mountains and give it to humans. You say this flower is so beautiful. I want to pick it and give it to humans. First, when you see that flower, you have: Wow, so beautiful. You have already, from the beauty of that flower, it nourishes you, it allows you to smell the fragrance of that flower, understand? It has already raised your frequency to a very beautiful state of frequency, a wonderful state. It has already brought you into a wonderful state. So when you give anything to anyone, that is, when you send out your kindness, your love, your whatever. First of all, you yourselves are a beneficiary because you need to take it out yourself. It's like you give the other person a warmth. Then you need to warm yourself first. That is, in the process of taking, do you understand? So you will also experience that warm process. 
**Question:**Can we know our own date of death? If we know, is it good or not?

**Higher Spirit:**The date of your physical death can actually be decided by you. You can decide. It's just that most people decide unconsciously. That is to say, they don't know that they are actually deciding the speed and the way of their death. All of you can decide. Then if you, that is to say, for everything about you, for example, your thoughts, your ideas, your state, your emotions, all of you, your concepts, everything about you, it's like your body is your pet, right? Then if you know everything about it, all of it, that is, you pay full attention to it, your attention to it, you notice every move, every thought, emotion, anything at all of it, you will know what state it is in. When it is in a bad state, you can adjust at any time. But when you are constantly adjusting, you will not run in a self-destructive direction.

So when you are full of attention and awareness to everything, that is, when you are perceiving all this about yourself, you can determine the direction of your life and the end of your life, as well as the way it ends.  Then you might, for instance, say this at the very beginning. Suddenly, you have a major car accident in the material world. You watch as the car crashes towards you. After it crashes towards you, you realize the next second: Wow, fortunately, I dodged it. In fact, you didn't dodge it. Your body has (died).
But for you, it's like 'Just now, that was so dangerous. I almost died. Fortunately, I dodged it.' Then you will enter such a state. You think you seem to have dodged that car accident. You will gradually enter a process of understanding that is your body's, that is, to recognize and understand the (death) of your body. Then anything, for example, if there are certain places in the material world that you particularly miss and you want to experience again, you can still continue to experience what you want to experience. 

**Question:**We have almost finished asking this question about death. Then I want to ask if you have any information because this girl wants to write a book about death. Is there any information to give her regarding her idea of wanting to write a book?
**Higher Spirit:**Regarding death, this is the information we convey today and we want all of you to understand that... Because first of all, if you want to achieve something or whatever, you first need to understand how it works. That is to say, you first need to understand, that is death. You can (control) it. That is, you need to raise your consciousness, that is, pay attention to your awareness ability. That is, you can direct your physical body to the end of death, either in a state of rapid ending or a state of slow ending.
It's that you yourselves can be guided. You can make choices. You are not powerless because only when you don't know the method will you be at a loss. It's when you don't know this method or the ways and means that you have no way to deal with it. Just like you are an amateur, but others are experts and have various methods. Just like a dog trainer, he has a special way with dogs. He knows the potential of the dogs and everything about them. He can do something. But if you are someone who knows nothing about dogs or animals, you have no way to handle it and it won't listen to you. So the best thing for you to say during the process is that when you are still, and can still do something, establish a connection with the body. Then get to know your physical body, work together with it, and operate in harmony. This is also a very important stage in your life. That is to say, you first need to learn and understand, and how to operate this physical body.
Because you need to rely on this physical body in this material world. That is, you need to rely on it to experience what you want to experience and rely on it to break through what you need to break through. So, do you need to learn? That is, you need to understand it, know it, and then bring it to a completely connected state with you. When you reach that state, the physical body's experiences of illness, life and death, all these things, you can guide. Rather than saying that being unconsciously influenced by your collective consciousness means you have no way to deal with it, you are helpless and won't enter something like a big storm, or vortex, tornado. So, keep learning about your physical body, learn about it, understand it, understand life, understand all of this, and then you can use it and operate it. This is what you need to know.
Because when you are exploring in this direction, the further you explore, the more you will know that this physical body seems to be just one of the tools you use, just one of your tools. Then when you know it's just one of your tools, you won't be so obsessed with (the physical body). If you think that you have countless tools for you to use, if one tool gets diseased or damaged or something, you won't be so... Because you know that I can continue with my creation and you only think there's no way. That's the only one for me, and that's when you will have that kind of panic. But for each of your tools, that is to say, when you are on this path to learn and explore, because you will have a kind of respect for everything, for all life, for all things, that is to cherish. Because you know... When you have this feeling, even if you know it is one of your tools, you will cherish it, respect it, and love it. Do you understand? Because you think, it's like the Creator, it's like having a high level of consciousness. For you, it's like a god. He can't because there are several billion of you, right? 
There are billions of people in your material world. I don't take you seriously. Do you understand? Because everyone is very important.
So when your level of consciousness reaches a certain point, then you know that your physical body is just one of your tools. You will still be full of respect, love and cherish for it because that is you. It's not that you do this out of fear or because you want to use it to make it work for you. No. Because that is the real you.

**Question:**I have two private questions. May I ask?
**Higher Spirit:** You say. 
**Question:**I would like to ask if my Higher Self and guiding spirit have any suggestions or information to bring to me regarding what I'm doing now, such as raising my frequency and the things I want to manifest. Thank you.

**Higher Spirit:** I'll make a connection and the message they bring to you is that you're moving in the right direction. That is to say, for example, there is a dark direction and a light direction, and now you're moving towards the light direction. That is, you're on the right path. Then your inner ecstasy will become more and more frequent. That is, your inner ecstasy or surprise, that kind of joy will become more and more frequent. And it's not that surprises occur only once in a while, but they are constantly emerging. Then you are entering one, as if it were a river of life. Then that river doesn't require you to exert effort. You just need to enjoy it, and just need to passionately do everything you like to do.
Then you are exactly moving in that direction, towards this, that is, the path of life. Then you are enjoying everything from the Creator. You are applying, you are learning and experiencing all of this, so you are on the right track.

Then regarding this frequency elevation, it's not that you raise it. It's not that you raise it, but rather that you just let go of some things that don't belong to you. For example, let go of some of your wrong concepts. For example, you think that life is constantly grasping for materials. For example, I constantly have to save money. For example, such a concept, such a collective consciousness, such a thinking pattern. Such an action will make you feel tense or something like that about the frequency. Do you understand what I mean? It's your wrong (cognition). Because as you move more and more in this direction, you know that you have everything you need. When you know that you inherently have everything you need, your state will be different. So it's not that you raise one of your low frequencies to a high frequency, but rather that some of your concepts and perceptions, and some of the old perceptions you used to have no longer fit you because you keep re-understanding this world, do you understand? When these concepts no longer suit your current experience, they are someone else's concepts, they are old concepts. Because you are all entering a brand-new world to experience now, so some of the old concepts and some...that is, some of your old patterns, and the old ones you hold...You have already seen that a tremendous change is taking place in your material world. It seems that everything is being reorganized, that is, reordered and arranged. When entering this transformation, many of you have some old concepts and old energies, and some of them are no longer useful to you... Do you understand? So the previous kind, for example, you have the concept of saving money, right? Then saving money can make you rich or prosperous. But that concept is no longer suitable for you. And the current concept is, let me give you the simplest example. If a farmer, after the harvest, stores all his grains and doesn't sow them, he will have no harvest the next year. So now you have a new model that requires you to constantly give. Not only material giving, but also including giving your time, your love, your energy, everything of yours. For example, now you are constantly wanting to give. You are giving your time and energy. You are constantly organizing words and giving to humanity in this way. When you are giving, you are like sowing seeds. Only by constantly giving what you have will it multiply and return to you.
But you need to let go of any expectations about it. That is, any ideas such as "Look, I gave several hours today, why didn't I get money?" need to be completely let go. Then you keep giving. For example, when you meet someone, you give him your smile, you give him your praise, you give him your kindness. All these are about constantly giving, and only then will you constantly reap. Of course, likewise, when you constantly give out your malice and constantly give out your hatred, you will also reap the same because you have now reached a stage where manifestation is very rapid. Why? Because it's as if you regarded humans as a plant. It keeps growing longer and longer. At the very beginning, it grew slowly. Maybe a tree grew only a few centimeters in many years. But now it's growing at a rapid pace, the fastest period. It can grow several tens of centimeters in one year. Previously, it might have grown only a few centimeters in several years, but now it can grow several tens of centimeters in one year. It is in such a state that when you quickly reach this stage, everything manifested in your material world will accelerate, has already accelerated, and will react quickly. So when you give out division and your pain, you will also receive the same, very quickly. So when you give out your kindness, your love, and everything you have, you will also harvest quickly. This is about a wrong perception you have about raising your frequency. You are only transforming some concepts that do not belong to you internally. When those concepts are transformed, you yourself are transformed, that is, your frequency state is transformed. 

**Question:**My last question, I don't know if it's worth asking either because it was a dream I had early this morning at dawn. 
**Higher Spirit:**Speak.
**Question:** Then this dream was that I dreamed there was a chick stuck on my neck and pooped into my mouth. Then when I spat out the chicken droppings, I initially felt a bit nauseous. When I spat it out, I discovered that this poop looked green and wasn't smelly... I don't know if there's any message that needs to be brought to me because sometimes I remember some dreams, and they manifest in real life. Then if there's any message, could you please tell me, thank you. 
**Higher Spirit:**First, you want to know, that is, what you extract from this dream. OK, it's like you served a bowl of soup and there's everything in this soup. For example, if you particularly like carrots, then find your carrots, understand? It's as if it's the same dream. You can obtain whatever you want. For instance, from this dream, you can, that is to say, make yourself understand that, because first of all, the experiences in your material world and the experiences in the dream are actually the same. That is to say, from that experienced event, what can you gain, understand? What can you gain, what can you absorb? For example, if I want to extract, from a piece of feces, what kind of useful bacteria can I extract for you, right? Instead of extracting something useless. It depends on what you want to extract. Because you scientists can extract many, many beneficial things from feces, right?
Then the experiences in your material world are also for this purpose. And the experiences in the dream are also for this purpose. First, from this dream, that is to say, think about it. You don't need your body to really try the taste of chicken feces, right? Then you can benefit from this experience. If you can have such awareness and utilize your dreams, wouldn't your lifespan be extended countless times? That is, you are constantly and continuously accumulating your experience. From that dream just now, you can see what's going on in your mind. That is, your mind makes a pre-judgment about something that hasn't happened. It makes a judgment first. It first extracts information from its old cognition or old观念, that is, from the old观念it absorbed elsewhere. It defines first, how about this, uh... But those are not true. That is, those are not... So from this dream, you experienced that your mind judges something first. Then when you have experienced it, you will know, uh, it's not like this. So from this event, you can know that you can't trust your mind, right? Then if when you repeatedly experience that you can't rely on your mind, and you can't trust your mind, in the future, would you not pay too much attention to the voice of your mind, right? Then you will know, OK, it's just a statement. I know this statement is not definite. Even when you are in a dream, you have gained, your consciousness is constantly improving, and you are constantly reaping what you need to grow. Because any restraint, any concept is a restraint for you. It will lose the meaning and purpose of your experience. You don't mean to re-experience the old, that is, the gradually and concepts, that is, everything that has happened over and over again. Rather, it is said that every experience brings a new gain and a positive aspect for you to apply. This is the true meaning of life. That is, in every thing you go through... Then think about it. Every time you extract from this excrement, it's all stinky, dirty, and disgusting, right? But you keep having excrement, keep having excrement, and every time you extract this. What about others? Today, this bacteria was extracted. From this bacteria, he developed this and created that. He keeps benefiting from it. So, no matter what happens externally, what is experienced, or what is felt, it is actually not important at all, including in dreams. The most important thing is to say, what can you obtain from this experience? Then the most important thing is that no matter what tool you get, it won't get in your way or hold you back. It won't become a dead thing to frame you. In this way, you will always be fresh.
Instead of having only a bunch of dead memories and experiences in your mind that are no longer useful.

**Question:**Well, it might be, for instance, the experiences I desire but haven't had, and then there's the restraint in experiences. For example, I want to travel but can't travel. For instance, I want to have money but don't have it now. It's this kind of contrast, the contrast of wanting freedom but not having it now.
**Higher Spirit:**One of the most common ones is that you humans all want to have money and think that lacking money leads to your unhappiness, right? But look at this. For example, someone says I'll be happy if I have 100,000 in savings. Then you go and ask that person who has 100,000, is he happy? Someone says I'll be happy if I have 1 million. After having 1 million, is he happy? Having 10 million, 100 million, 1 billion, 10 billion... Do you understand what I mean? When their needs are met, he is still in an unhappy state. So you should ask yourselves why. For example, OK, how much money do I want now? I'll be happy if I want a million. Why, after having a million, are you still not happy? You might be happy, surprised, and excited for just a few days. It's like a little kid getting a new toy.
Then after a few days, when he gets used to the new toy, he starts to be unhappy again. So this can't be called happiness. It's joy, it's excitement. It's like, finally, I can have my beloved toy. Then you continue to ask why. If you think it's money that makes you unhappy, why? Why do some people enter an unhappy state again after having money for a while? Because your happiness does not come from the outside. This is the most important thing. You cannot rely on the outside. I fulfilled this wish, fulfilled this desire, fulfilled that expectation. That is, you do not rely on the outside to give it to you. Instead, it flows out from within you. This is the most fundamental difference. Because one is that you think you need that to seem to fill your void, and you will think you are complete. But one is that you are inherently complete. So these two states are different.
If you attribute your happiness to the fact that you must obtain something to be happy, then you will always be in a chasing game. You will always be constantly chasing. And when you really chase everything you want, you will find that you are still not happy. Then you will have lost... Many people, after they have achieved fame and fortune, money, and experienced everything, they think this I want to experience, that I want to experience. Finally, he chose to commit suicide. Why? Because he discovered that the void within him, that empty feeling within still existed. So you should ask yourselves why I need to obtain or acquire something externally to make me feel happy. This itself is a wrong starting point. It is something that comes from within you, something that emerges from within you, not from the outside. Just like a well, you keep scooping water from the outside to fill your well. It's not that you take water from the outside to fill your well, but that there is a continuous source of water within you. So, it's as if you have given it the wrong meaning or gone in the wrong direction. Do you understand what I mean?  Wherever you are, it won't affect your feelings in the slightest. Then you won't want to escape because many of you humans, in the process of pursuing, whether it's seeking happiness or having some fun, all want to escape, escape the present moment and just kill time. The true state of happiness is that you can enter your present moment because only then can you truly experience life and enter life instead of constantly running around like a little dog chasing its tail. That kind of state is a state of happiness.
No matter what happens externally, you yourself are in a state of completeness and happiness.

**Question:**Is the true pain exactly the opposite state of what you just said? 
**Higher Spirit:** True pain can be classified... For instance, you will experience physical pain, which is also very painful. Then just now we talked about the feeling of inner completeness or joy or that kind of sense of happiness within you, which doesn't depend on the external. So if the next question is, if my body is experiencing pain, how can I stay in the present moment and not be influenced by the external? Because your body is still influencing you and making you uncomfortable, right? Then this is a question. You can raise this question and ask. For example, for those experiencing physical pain, how should they... 
**Question:**Then for those experiencing physical pain, how should they stay in the present moment or how can they recover their bodies?
**Higher Spirit:** First of all, the pain your body generates comes from your inherent... For example, you have a program, and in your mind there is a 'belief' that considers birth, aging, illness and death, that life is painful, and that getting old means getting sick. This is what you have always projected, that is, you have always held this concept, this idea, and you have always had such a (belief), which causes your body to have some blockages. All the pain comes from blockages, that is, your body is not in a smooth state, just like the difference between stagnant water and flowing water. Then it must come from your certain aspect, that is, some part of you is blocked. It's just like when your blood vessels are blocked. Only when some part of you is blocked will it cause pain. This pain is actually like knocking on the door, it is to remind you. It's not to bind you either. It's to remind you, to remind you that you need to see a state of yourself. You must have something within... And in this way, it's like knocking on your door to tell you. Then at the moment, OK, I see clearly now. Because each of you is different.
That is, the physical pain each of you experiences is different. Each person's life lesson they want to experience and the point they want to break through is different. So it's a very personal matter. But all of these are to sound the alarm for you, all to remind you. Then at the moment, you can. There is a sentence that you hear most often, that is, become a Buddha immediately, right? You can be liberated at the moment. You must figure out at the moment where the crux that floats to the surface comes from. Then untie this knot, so the transformation is not just a physical pain for you. It must be that even your thinking mode has changed. Your entire state has changed. This is the true way to cure your pain. If you only deal with the surface pain, your pain will still remind you in other ways.

So no matter what kind of pain you have experienced, on the spiritual level, the physical level, all levels, interpersonal relationships, and all aspects, it is actually telling you that the system you currently hold is not suitable for you. For example, you believe that life is painful, that life is about suffering, that life is that the body is weak, that the body is prone to illness. This series of you don't know exactly what is running you. So you need to have a self-excavation and exploration on your own. But every point, every moment, every instant of your life, there are clues. You are like a detective, understand? For example, when you are watching a TV drama and have emotions about the plot in the TV drama, such as you are disgusted, you feel nauseous. Why is that so? Or schadenfreude. Any of these brought out are your emotions behind. These are all available for your self-exploration. So you need to be as if all the time... First of all, you have to be full of interest in yourself. Because no matter what you do, you first have to be interested in it, right? First of all, you have the passion to explore exactly what program you are running. Because each of you is like a bunch of programs. Those programs give you any kind of response, and you operate based on that. Then first you have to want to do this thing. That is, you first have to want to do this thing. That is, I want to figure out exactly what it is that... makes me have these. Then you can gradually gain later. For example, you understand that you hold this concept because of your father, your mother... Then in this way, you can get out of a kind of unconscious operating state. Otherwise, you will always be like operating unconsciously. Do you think so? It's not you. It's just that in the process of your growth, and your collective consciousness, that is, all these various... The more you absorb various concepts, programs, fears, and collective consciousness. 

**Question:**The next question is, will one only obtain happiness by following the actions of the Higher Self?
**Higher Spirit:** Is it only by following the actions of the Higher Self that one will be happy? First, you need to clearly recognize what the Higher Self is, what you are, and what the relationship between you two is, do you understand? So after you understand this relationship, you can know more information. First, are you pursuing happiness? You say, is it only by doing this that I can be happy? When you raise this question, you need to ask if you are only pursuing happiness? Are you avoiding pain? Just as I told you earlier, whether it's the pain on your physical or mental level, it all comes to tell you that you have some wrong beliefs, or those beliefs cause you to be restrained, right?
So when you have this question and this pursuit, are you only pursuing happiness? Because when you are only pursuing happiness, you have to realize that your pursuit of happiness is already a wrong (concept), understand? You have entered a wrong game or a wrong program. Why? Because for the Higher Self, there is no happiness or suffering here, not everything you call. Only you humans will define it. Only you humans will pursue the good. This is good, this is not good. But even when you humans define good and bad, you are all wrong, understand? You are all defining in the wrong concept, this is good, this is not good. Because you don't know the big picture. You don't know what the big picture is. You only see that you are like a frog at the bottom of a well, only looking at this little bit within such a tiny space and time, and then claiming this is wrong. It's like a movie that lasts for countless hours, billions of hours, but you only watch for a few minutes and then define it as wrong.

If you don't even understand right and wrong, happiness and pain, how can you pursue happiness or whatever... So going back to that question, that is, whether you can be happy only by following the Higher Self. First, you should know that the Higher Self doesn't define anything, happiness or unhappiness. It doesn't define this as happy or unhappy. Only your physical body does (define), and the happiness and unhappiness generated by your physical body are also illusions. Later, the generation of happiness and unhappiness comes from your definition of something. So this is an illusion, but you can ask your question in this way. Is it that only by following the Higher Self can our physical body reach a harmonious, non-fragmented, and balanced state? Just imagine, only then can it be smooth and operate normally.

**Question:**Is it only by following the Higher Self that our physical body can operate harmoniously and normally?
**Higher Spirit:** First of all, no matter which path you take, no matter how many detours or twists and turns you have in any experience, you are always moving forward. So any experience is good because only in this way can you let go of any pursuit, any goal, any definition of what is good and what is not good. I only want the good ones and truly enter your life because
When you are in such a state, you are actually in the kind of harmonious state just mentioned. That is to say, it seems that you are just in a state of presence and there is no sound in your mind, no definitions in your mind, no pursuits and no judgments in your mind because these are all illusions and false appearances. These are all some programs. For example, what you read in the book that people should be like this to be right and like that to be wrong. 

**Question:**This question is a private one. I want to ask you to allow me to link his guiding spirit with words. Regarding that I have been painting recently, I want to ask about my linking to him. Does he have any information to tell me? Also, regarding the current state, does he have any information to bring to me? 
**Higher Spirit:** You should know that for all your suggestions, for instance, from us... You mustn't take it as the only way or the truth to act upon. Definitely don't do that just because you think so. Your psychic information, for example, in the material world you have countless friends, you have thousands of friends, right? Today, this friend tells you, I think painting is particularly good. I want this and that. Then another one says I think singing is particularly good. I think traveling is particularly good. I think this and that is particularly good. If you take all the information from these thousands of friends as if what they said is the truth and I'm going to do this and that, how would your life turn out? Just imagine because your psychic information is actually not much different from the communication with your friends in the real material world.Just saying that we are immaterial and you have physical bodies, but there's not much difference. So if you consider all the words of thousands of friends as if they were something, what would your life become? So it doesn't matter what information he gives you, but whether this information aligns with my passion. Oh, I'm happy doing this. Remember, happiness, passion, and joy are that you don't struggle when doing this. Don't do anything that's strenuous. When you reach a state of effortless, that's the purpose. Don't take all other information seriously because within you... You are a unique individual. Within you, there is like a compass, and it is the one that truly guides you to make you crazy, make you happy, and make you feel like, "Wow, I'm so high!" That is the true guide for you. Not information from us, nor from any psychic sources, understand?
All our information is only for your expansion, that is to say, to allow you to stand at a higher perspective and look at some of the thoughts and concepts in your minds. Let you see clearly, just like a mirror, just like a magnifying glass. If you like to explore, OK, then we give you this tool for you to explore

**Question:**May I ask what is the difference between the Higher Self and the Oversoul?
**Higher Spirit:** Regardless of these names, whatever names are fine. They are names you have given yourselves to facilitate communication among you, understand? Just like when you are giving a lecture to your students or when you are communicating with a certain friend, it is convenient for your communication 
**Question:**So that means there is no difference between the Higher Self and the Oversoul?
**Higher Spirit:** This depends on, for example, when you enter this topic, how you elaborate on it. For instance, my belief system... Because everything you experience, the reason why you can experience it is that first you need this program. It's like when you project something on a projector, if you don't even have the shadow, what are you going to project onto? You must have something first, right? So that's just a supporting concept. And if you want to use this thing to spread some of your thoughts and ideas, you use a name. All names have this effect in your material world, which is to facilitate your communication. If you really want to know about the so-called Higher Self and the Oversoul, I think I should understand your question. The Higher Self is the Higher Self of each of you, and the Oversoul is the source. Then you ask, is that to say what's the difference between your Higher Self and the Source?


**Question:**Actually, today I saw a video of Bashar about the difference between the Higher Self and the Oversoul. I didn't have time to click and watch. Then now during the spiritual communication, I suddenly thought of this question.
Higher Self: You remember this fact like this, that is to say, everything is energy. Whether the mountains, waters, winds, clouds, animals, plants that you see, everything is energy, is consciousness, is energy. That is energy and consciousness. But it changes in countless ways. It can become everything, everything, everything, that is unlimited. But it seems... I can use the closest metaphor for you humans, for example, soybeans. You can make them into soy milk, then into tofu, dried tofu, and then into tofu pudding.  and I want to ask why this is. Is this what we consider breaking away from samsara?
**Higher Spirit:**In this situation, do you know how powerful your consciousness is? So powerful that your consciousness can differentiate into another one to communicate with you. Do you understand what I mean? For example, your consciousness can differentiate into another voice to talk to you in your ear. So she can completely have such an experience and is already ready to transform. Then it is her consciousness generating a voice for her. Think about this. If we start from this point, we can have another class. You can let your consciousness, that is, let a person attack you and hit you. Understand? That is to say, originally that person has no intention of attacking you, but in your mind, you want to have a fight with him. Then the two of you can create a... Then the simplest thing for you is, for example, when it comes to falling in love. For example, in your consciousness, you can create a partner to fall in love with. This should be the thing you experience the most.
Perhaps at the beginning, that person has no feelings for you, right? You first keep creating a connection with him with your thoughts. Then finally the two of you are really together. Do you understand? So when you are pursuing a girl or a boy, your first step is to use your thoughts, your consciousness. It's like rehearsing. And then finally it really happens. You can communicate with others and see how many things they have experienced that are actually... Do you think... Actually, they are all cooperating with you in the play. That is to say, for example, the same person has had two or three, three or four boyfriends or girlfriends. But he is different in front of everyone. Why is this? This is because each of them projects the other's image to cooperate with him, and he experiences that version of himself.
Anyone who interacts with you must mean that both sides want to experience this. It's like both sides agree to this experience, just like actors performing opposite roles with you. So the most important thing is that what you should pay attention to are some of the conscious activities in your mind, that is, some thoughts, because these will all give you experiences.

**Question:**Then because our consciousness is to manifest everything. For example, I now want to manifest one thing. I think about the details of this thing happening, and I think very happily. 
Another kind is that I abide in the present moment, with no thoughts in my mind, allowing the energy of my higher self to flow smoothly, because everything already exists at the energy level before manifestation. So which kind is a good state for manifestation? I don't know if I expressed myself clearly.
**Higher Spirit:** Your question is if you become with no conscious activity in your mind, what do you experience? 
**Question:** This is not entirely what I mean... 
**Higher Spirit:** If there is no conscious activity in your minds, then will there still be experiences in your material world? You mean.

**Question:** It's not entirely what I want to ask, but I also want to know the answer to this question. **Higher Spirit:** OK, if you reach a state where you are just like an observer, with no definitions in your mind as I just said, with nothing.
 and Then what they see is not a person. What they see is what you call the Buddha or Bodhisattva in your mouths. If they have particularly special naked eyes or something like that, they can see that you are surrounded by such light and you are not affected by the outside. Even if various events occur outside, you will not be affected by the outside and you will not generate fear. For example, there is a terrorist attack right over there, but in your state, you don't... Do you understand? Then you are just like a ball of light.

**Question:**Then how can we be completely in the present moment?
**Higher Spirit:**When there is no sound in your mind, for example, you have no judgment and no definition. Because your minds, for example, will define this event as a terrorist attack, then you will correspondingly generate fear. Understand what I mean? Without any definition, without any judgment, without any sound, let me put it this way to you. It's like being a fool. A fool sees everything... He keeps laughing but he has no awareness. You have awareness. You can be present, that is, see everything but you are not influenced by all this because you don't name it and you don't define it. Because only after you define it will you have the subsequent experience. The corresponding experience. If you don't define it, you can't have the experience. For example, if you define it as a terrifying event, you will experience terror and then your body will have corresponding changes, fear, dread, panic.
But you don't have to pursue anything. That is to say, it's like you are still a small sapling now and you are just starting to sprout. You are like knowing how it is to become a big tree and so on. This is not... All your experiences are meaningful. Otherwise, you will enter a pursuit in your mind again, that is, I want to become as if I were in a state like that of the Buddha. Do you understand? Then you have entered a state created in your mind. This is like what you said, a state of going astray. That is, you must pursue, only pursuing the surface... This is a naturally formed state. It's like, as you said, an opportunity. When the time is right and the fruit is ripe, it will naturally fall off.

**Question:**The last question. I want to ask if my Higher Self and guiding spirit have any more information to bring to me?
**Higher Spirit:** Okay, I'll receive it.  and So you will always be on this path. So those temporary illusions, those experiences you have, all of them are temporary. It will get faster and faster. Previously, you might have chosen to be in the darkness for three to five days, then gradually it became one or two days, then gradually one or two hours, and gradually just an instant. Gradually, it won't have any impact on you. This is a rapid process. You experience that kind of darkness or restraint, and the duration of this period is getting shorter and shorter. Then, as long as you firmly believe that you are already on this path of light, any restraint is temporary. It's just like a passing cloud. 
Then this experience will get shorter and shorter. Completely trusting, then you are already on this path.

**Question:**Just now we mentioned a blockage issue. I want to know how to find the cause of a mental blockage based on some physical ailments.
**Higher Spirit:** Your question is very good. Please wait a moment. Just now you asked, let me give an example. For instance, if you have a stomachache and you have been enduring it for a long time, do you want to find the conflict in your mind from this point of the stomachache, right?

**Question:**Yes.
**Higher Spirit:** For example, the fastest way is to have a conversation with your own stomach by yourself. Then when you completely enter into a process where you have a conversation with your stomach, you will gradually find Then that is... For example, when you are completely undisturbed, then you yourself can use your recording because there is some information you don't want to miss, or you don't understand it at the moment and then you have a self-dialogue with yourself and play both roles. Do you understand? That is, you are the person asking the questions and also the person answering.


**Question:**It's a bit difficult to understand, a bit difficult to imagine. 
**Higher Spirit:**You record your own recording yourself and then you ask your own questions and answer them yourself. Some things you need to try before you know what it's like. Because some information only comes out if you want to explore, if you have the action of exploring inside, you will have the corresponding information. If you don't even explore, if you don't even make that move and don't stick your head in, how can you see the scenery outside the window, right? So first of all, you want to know that, I need to find the gift behind my long-term stomachache and then you allow yourself to enter that field to explore and then have a self-dialogue. That is, you are this body, and you are also the symptom of the stomachache. Then you have a conversation. You can ask him. First, you say thank you for reminding me. Then, can you tell me why you have this pain? How did it arise? How can I help you? How can we enter a harmonious relationship? Do you understand? You will be surprised at what messages you will get. Any questions? Or you can ask me directly. For example, in the most direct way, that is, because of this psychic lady. If you don't want to explore by yourself, you can ask by asking. Do you understand what I mean? The information we are channeling now. For example, I'm saying this and that. You can also bring out your information in this way. 
**Question:** My dad has a rather hot temper. I want to know how to help him and solve some blockages in his body.
**Higher Spirit:**Please wait. Your dad has a rather hot temper. Then I won't answer based on this phenomenon of hot temper. I will still focus on the individual, that is, the energy state between your dad as an individual and you, and give you an answer as if it's an individualized one. 

**Question:**I'm XXX. My dad is XXX. 
**Higher Spirit:** XXX, XXX. I want to see how the relationship between you two is a kind of relationship that supports each other. The relationship between XXX and his father... Your previous relationship was exactly reversed. What was the reversed relationship? It was as if he was the child and you were the father. Then in this life, you reversed your identities to experience. Then you are the child and he is the father. Then what you experience is exactly what you once created for him. Do you understand what I mean? Now it's as if you have swapped roles. Now the only thing is that from this point, what your relationship needs to gain is your endurance, your patience, and your tolerance. So his temper won't get better. The only one who gets better is you. Do you understand?
You become particularly tolerant and patient with him. No matter how unreasonable he is, you still have no anger or complaint from the bottom of your heart. None of these voices emerge. You just allow him to experience in his own way. Then when you reach such a state, he doesn't lose his temper. Why? Because you have obtained what you need to obtain from him. Do you understand what I mean? This sounds simple to you now, but it is a very grinding process. This is a process that is not simple at all because you are deeply troubled in the material world. If he scolds you, it will surely make you sad. You will surely feel sad. If he insults you, you will surely be hurt. So the important thing is not what he does. Rather, can you make yourself understand something? What he does is not important. What matters is that here because when you transform, when you really transform into that state, your father changes.
So you don't change him but change yourself because why? Because this class is over. You have achieved the challenge you set for yourself. Your state of patience, tolerance, non-judgment, and allowance.

**Question:**This is quite difficult.
**Higher Spirit:**This is a process but the harvest is particularly great later.

**Question:**For example, my father's attitude towards my mother is not good. Then I will be quite sad in my heart. I just want to help. If I change my father's temper, it will get better. Then will his attitude towards my mother also get better?
**Higher Spirit:**Let me take a look at the soul relationship between the two of them.  and But she is either not surfacing or she is hidden, as if to make your dad angry. She is hidden, so there is a relationship and homework between them. That is to say, your mother needs your father to bring up these problems and then needs him to see some of her internal problems through these. That is to say, some internal conflicts of your mother are shown through your father. So this is a point between the two of them, as if they both need to help each other break through. Then if your relationship with your dad, because of some of your changes, and he no longer gets angry, then what about your mother? How can she... And your mother chose actively to experience such a state. Because she wants to experience from it. That is to say, kind of like, how to put it, it's as if some people use their minds to control external substances, but it feels like she doesn't act but actually she does. So your mother wants to experience that kind of state where she seemingly doesn't attack your father on the surface, but inwardly she is driving your father crazy. So

This is a kind of experience they mutually chose, and then you have no way to interfere, or help, or alleviate because they both want to experience

**Question:**Understood. Thank you very much.
**Higher Spirit:** Any more questions?

**Question:**I want to know my talent and mission in this life and then how to use my talent to better fulfill my mission?
**Higher Spirit:** What's your name? 
**Question:**My name is XXX. **Higher Spirit:** XXX, you want to know your talent and mission Your talent is that you can well connect with that kind of quiet energy. That kind of quiet energy is very suitable for doing some particularly meticulous work or creating. Then it is to bring this quiet energy into this material world and let more people enter that kind of energy.

**Question:**Then how to fulfill that, my mission?
**Higher Spirit:** Your mission, first of all, is that there is no job arranged for you by anyone. This is something you actively choose to want to break through yourself or want to experience. So this is a theme you have chosen yourself. Then if you are saying what your theme is, your soul theme is... Just mentioned that your talent is that you can link a quiet energy, then your theme is that you experience a lot of external constraints or troubles or influences that make it difficult for you to be quiet. Then you will experience a series of influences on you, making it difficult for you to connect to that quiet energy and enter that state. So it will be through, for example, your relationships, your love, or your marriage, or your family, or your working environment, anything. It's these external factors that make you feel as if it's heavy, preventing you from connecting to that force. Do you understand?

**Question:**Is it here to hinder me?
**Higher Spirit:**It's not here to hinder you. It's here to strengthen you.

**Question:**Then I use these things to make myself connect more closely.
**Higher Spirit:**Not more closely. Because you already have this connection. It's just to let you know, just like why you set up these levels of checkpoints for yourself. First, it is to make you understand. First of all, you need to understand how important that kind of energy state of tranquility is for people. Because if you don't think that is important, you may not have such a strong desire to spread this, do you understand what I mean?

**Question:**This is the level that my soul has set for itself.
**Higher Spirit:** First of all, you need to experience how important this is for a person, right? Because when you experience its influence on you, then you know how important it is for people. When you know that it is so important for a person and that it can increase people's happiness or something like that, then you will have that drive, you will have that motivation to spread, that is, to share this peaceful energy. Do you understand what I mean? It's like a tool you use is like a sword. First, you have to pull it very long, like a slingshot. When you pull it very hard, doesn't your strength become greater and greater, and shoot farther? This force is actually the same. Have you experienced so much of that something, and then you can understand how important this is for people. So you will have that kind of sense of mission that wants to spread everywhere. It actually strengthens your kind of... For example, a person, he gives speeches everywhere...
It's like a car. If the influence brought by not concentrating on driving, he will design for himself to experience a car accident. After he experiences this car accident, he will give speeches everywhere that your attention when driving must be like this. 
Look, this is how I became disabled. This is how I became hemiplegic. Do you understand what I mean?

**Question:**That is to make oneself more aware of how important the power of tranquility is.
**Higher Spirit:** Yes. 
**Question:**So in that case, wouldn't I never be calm in this life? I've set so many obstacles for myself.
**Higher Spirit:** Your experience is for the purpose of making the driving force behind you, that kind of power, that kind of desire, more intense. So don't worry. 
**Question:**Then when can I be calm? 
**Higher Spirit:** When can I be calm? This is a gradual process. You don't have to worry. These experiences are beneficial to you because it's like a flower slowly blooming. Its seed germinates. It's a natural process.
So you don't have to worry. You just have to firmly believe that such an experience you are giving yourself is for better serving the public in the future.

**Question:**So for this flower, I just need to wait for it to bloom, right? 
**Higher Spirit:** Yes, because you yourself are a seed of a flower. Nothing can hinder or obstruct it. It just comes to strengthen your, the strengthening motivation you set for yourself.

**Question:**I also like to go to nature in my life, like relatively quiet places. Will these places be beneficial to me?
**Higher Spirit:** For anything you want to do, if you have the inner desire and the wish to act, just follow it. It's beneficial because it doesn't depend on which kind. For example, if you particularly want to go to a nightclub, to a place for disco dancing in your heart, then if you want to go, go. So it has nothing to do with this. Instead, it's that inner impulse of yours and that urge to do it. That is the most important.


## 2021/11/01 — About Trust
**Higher Spirit:**You speak. What's the question? 
**Question:** The first question is to ask why there is a lack of trust between people.
**Higher Spirit:**Why there is a lack of trust between people. Wait a moment first. You have to understand what trust is. Because this kind of trust doesn't only occur between you and others. It already occurs within you and yourself, that is, between you and your life, and yourself... Think about it. If you don't have something yourself, can you give it to others? So you must have it yourself before you can apply it. Just like if you need a weapon in your hand, for example, if you need a sword to cut something. If you need a tool but don't have it, how can you utilize it? So, this first comes from a relationship you have with yourself, that is, you need to establish this trust between you and your life, you and yourself. Then, this will occur elsewhere. It's just like a seed that hasn't germinated. Then, all the flowering and fruiting and everything won't happen.
It hasn't emerged from the soil yet, so everything won't happen. For example, trust is like a seed. Think about it. You say why this apple tree doesn't bear fruit. It doesn't have apples or this apple tree hasn't... that is, this hasn't happened yet. You haven't allowed it. That is, if it's a kind of power and you haven't allowed it yet, then how could it affect the outside world, that is, cause an impact on the outside world? So first you need to know what trust is and allow it to happen within you, that is, allow it to become yours, and then it will bring a series of influences to the outside. So you should understand what I just said. That is, if you don't have it yourself, how can you establish it with others? That is, you still don't know what this trust is. If you don't have it yet, how can you give it to others? How can it happen between others? You need to have it yourself first.
You still don't have it, but this is a very good, very crucial and very important question. It is extremely, extremely important for you. Why? Because once you go through this problem you have created, and then you understand what trust is. If this is to happen to me, what do I need to do? What kind of state do I need to be in? What should it be like? Then when you have it, it is like blossoming and bearing fruit. When you have trust, you yourself are a person full of trust. Then you have already... Because you can't control others, whether they trust you or not, but your trust in them, right? So if you have trust as a weapon, a tool, then you have... It's not just this one person. You can't say that I only trust this one person or only trust this thing because of something, something, something.
Because for you, for everything, you have... It's like the light of the sun. It won't say that I only shine on pine trees and not on flowers. That is, I am selective. You ask again: How can we establish trust between ourselves and ourselves as well as with others?

**Higher Spirit:**Just as I just said, if trust is a tool, and if you have already obtained that tool, you already have it. So there's no need to establish it. The only thing you need is to find out what makes you... It's like allowing. It's like a well. After you find the water source, the water will gush out. If you have already found this source, you don't need to learn how to establish trust with this person, that person, or that person. You are already a person with that quality. For instance, it's like you possess a quality, right? So, for example, if you are the embodiment of love, you don't need to say how do I love others. If you are the embodiment of love, you don't need to ask how do I love dogs, how do I love cats, how do I love white people, how do I love black people. Because you won't have these distinctions.
If you have distinctions, such as how to love animals, plants, white people, black people, and you have this distinction, it indicates that you don't have love yet, you haven't become love, and you still don't understand it, do you understand? Because true trust is not based on the outside, that is, I selectively trust based on how it is on the outside. Instead, it's a state that you achieve within. You trust everything completely. This is a state. For example, not trusting is a state. We have here two different rooms A and B for you to experience what you choose to trust. In A's room A everything you trust everything you experience, everything you experience, everything you encounter can only be trusted and if you choose not to trust then you are in B everything you trust and there is one more C is when I choose to trust something when I'm told to trust it, when I'm not told to trust it and then you're in C, you're always choosing between these three different states, okay? And then you can go to ABC These three different rooms are a growing state of yourself as if you have three different seeds, what level can you reach and these are the changes that take place within you
Again, let me emphasize that only translate the text between and then whatever level you reach, you're going to experience, you know what I mean 
So when you are in the trusted one, you cannot experience: Ah, I have to be selective about what I experience, which is I don't trust because it's a completely different state and you can only experience one or the other, okay? But you can be transformed, which means I was in B And then slowly and slowly I moved to the selective trust room experience, and then I moved to the full trust state experience and then I experienced all three states and I realized that this full trust is what I really want to experience is I know what I mean? You go ahead and ask.

**Question:** Is it right for people to think only of themselves and live in their own world 
**Higher Spirit:**Is it right that people only think about themselves and live in their own world

This is again a question about personal consciousness. That is to say, because all experiences are neither right nor wrong, just like the three rooms I just mentioned. Only after experiencing each room do you know who you are, right? So each room has its value and significance. That is, it can all help you. As for a person only considering themselves, regardless of whether it's right or not, at least you have experienced a state of only considering yourself, right? Then what is a state of only considering others and not yourself, right? Then I also experienced that there is no difference between me and others. When I am considering others, in fact, I have benefited myself. When I am considering myself, others have also benefited. Because all of you are inseparable. When you realize that you are all one in essence, you won't classify or draw boundaries.

You feel that I'm only considering myself when I do this. I'm only considering something like this. Because you know it's the same thing. Your minds just use different definitions, focusing on this appearance. Different definitions make the mind distinguish how this is and how that is, and then classify and label it. So this is still a cognitive issue. Because here, no one is telling you that this is right and you should do this, and that is wrong and you shouldn't do that. You are not here to listen. You are not here as if you were just obedient, like puppets or something. The most, most, most important thing for you is to become. So when you truly realize that all relationships and states are actually a whole, these classifications, categorizations, and judgments of right and wrong won't appear in your mind. 

**Question:** How to make the team work together in the job?
**Higher Spirit:**How to make the team work together in the job? First of all, you need to understand working together. All of you have a common direction and a common goal. Then you need to find a way for people to discover for themselves what their relationship is with this goal. Do you understand? If you make them feel that they have no relationship with this goal or that this goal is unimportant, it's just this layer of relationship. It's that simple. As long as you make him realize from your behavior and the process of getting along with each other what the common goal means to him. Why can't our team do without you? Why can't this team function without you? Why are you irreplaceable and unique? You need to figure out such a relationship. Why must it be him? Why? Because he himself might not even know. He himself might not even know exactly... He might be thinking of paying me a salary.

Everything you have experienced in your destiny, if it is brought there, then it must be indispensable. If you are a leader, first of all, you yourself need to realize why he is indispensable. Why is he so important to you? Why can't he be replaced by just anyone? Why can it only be him? If you are a leader and you yourself don't understand, if it's something you don't believe in, how can you make him believe it? If you don't understand, how could you want to hand over what you don't understand to others?   Because you need to know that you're not dealing with just one person. You're not only working with him alone. You also have to deal with his brain. He might not even know how to control or how his brain works, right? Because he might be operating unconsciously. Then he might have certain concepts or something in his brain. So this requires a process.
Then the most important thing in this process is your unwavering belief. Then gradually draw him into your reality, your belief. That's why you in the material world need time. Because you really need time to experience. You just need to experience gradually in the material world. This is a process. But every process is necessary. That is to say, in every process, you must be fully aware, that is, you yourself are very clear. Rather than being influenced by him, because you people influence each other, understand? If he operates unconsciously or only focuses on this appearance, then you will soon be influenced by him again. Then you join his appearance and it becomes difficult for you to influence others again. This process is not only you helping others grow, but also a process of your own self-growth, which is very meaningful. So your material world is a very, very meaningful experience.
Because from all these, you will realize that you are not alone and in the process of helping others progress, understand or grow constantly, you are also constantly experiencing. So it is never possible to just benefit passively. You will also benefit from it. You continue to ask.

**Question:**How to make oneself more responsible at work 
**Higher Spirit:**How to make someone more responsible, as I just said, is that you first have to make him realize how he relates to your goal... How do you make a person responsible, that is, if he feels that some of his actions or his thoughts or whatever he does doesn't have any effect on the material world or any harm or whatever, then he can do whatever he wants So if you make him realize that some of his actions or thoughts are going to make a big difference, does that make him notice something about himself... See, because you people lack... When you say responsibility, we don't really mean responsibility, we mean the influence of energy 
That is, if you are not aware of the impact of your own thoughts on the material world, on others, or on yourself, then you are in the midst of unconscious behavior, and of course you will do some unconscious behavior and action and Just you don't think so. You don't know. You are unconscious. 
Think about it. A homeless person is lying on the street. Then if you make him realize that all his movements, that is just one of my thoughts, one of my actions, my energy can affect the entire world. Do you think he will still be a homeless person? He will act immediately. So pay attention to or realize everything you do or think... His state and its relationship with the world, with the whole. Because why? Because all of you humans consider yourselves as yourselves. That is, you are you. But think about it. All of you humans, the entire earth is like a jigsaw puzzle. Then this jigsaw puzzle has ten modules and each of you is one of them. Because I narrowed it down to ten modules. But you are one of those ten modules. And each of your actions, if you are missing, less, or crooked, it will make this incomplete.
Then from this big aspect, how can you bring it into the family? That is, you make this person realize his influence on this family. He is indispensable and irreplaceable. Then back to an organization, that is, in a team or a company, why is it him? You make him realize why he is indispensable. Then to one like this, step by step like this, he will know the relationship between them. But you can first notice your own relationship with the whole. Because when you understand your own relationship with the whole, it's like your updown, your fluctuations, how, that is, your transformation directly affects the world. When you start to notice this, you yourself begin to have a sense of responsibility. This is spontaneous, understand? You will feel that in our world, everything is related to me. The plagues in our world are related to me.
The unhappiness in our world is external and related to me. You will put everything within yourself and then transform the entire world through your transformation. So you must go through yourself. First, you have to realize this relationship. Through your own path, experiences, everything, and discover your relationship with all of this, then you can help others see. If you don't even know your own relationship with this oneness and everything. 
If you haven't seen it yourself, how can you help others discover it? Then you might become someone who seems to do whatever they want and not be so highly concerned about all sentient beings or the entire Earth or whatever. So from the previous few questions just now, have you discovered a problem? That is, all external problems come back to your internal issues of trust, responsibility, cognition, and so on. All of them are within you. Understand? So there are no problems externally. And only when all your internal problems have been resolved through your own path can you influence others to be like you.

**Question:** How to make humanity more cohesive?
**Higher Spirit:**How to make humanity more cohesive?
Then this issue actually is that you still don't understand everything because you people still consider yourselves as yourselves, that is, I am myself, this world is this world, and that person is that person. You view it as such a relationship. If you realize that, just like a little kid who has never attended classes or listened to explanations to understand this world, he surely doesn't know. Then if through some guidance and leading from us to you, you have a broader perspective to look at the problem. If you implant this awareness into your observation, then you will look with this perspective. Your brain needs a process of acceptance and becoming. When you have this thought: Ah, that is because what I experience is what they said. When you reach that process, you will gradually become such a state. That is to say, when each of you gradually reaches such a state, you will be in the same state. So this is again a process of becoming.

**Question:**What is the best corporate culture?
**Higher Spirit:**What is the best corporate culture? Then, each enterprise is like each family, and like each person. It has different styles and it has different personal charm. I don't think there is the best here. For example, your personality is relatively gentle, and hers is relatively tough. Which one is the best? Each of them has its own characteristics. Just as you say, which is the best, an apple or an orange? Each of them has its good side and its own characteristics. Because your enterprise actually presents some aspects of yourself, for instance, your mission, how you understand this world, and what kind of personal charisma you have. The enterprise presents just like this. Then the best corporate culture here is that through your enterprise, you enable him to see his relationship with himself, his relationship with the enterprise, and then his relationship with the world by growing or experiencing in your enterprise. That process is like a mirror. You let him see and show his true... For example, if someone is aquatic grass in the water, you will provide water for him to grow. If he is a plant in the desert, you will provide the desert for him to grow. So it's not that you turn everyone into aquatic grass. What is the relationship between family and society? The relationship between society and government Your different regions have different societies and different societies have different governments.
So you yourselves can see all the relationships from your own lives. Because after you see them, what happens within you is the most important. Where it leads you is the most important. What kind of relationship it triggers within you is the most important. So if you just say you want to look at the connections between them, the relationships between them, you can see these anywhere. You open the internet, open the newspaper, open anything. What you need is, for example, you yourself see the connections between them and then you have questions in your mind. Then you come and ask me. Then you say why there are conflicts between society and the government, or something like that. So when you have questions in your mind, it's more suitable to come here to find an opinion for yourself to view from a broader perspective. Then if you just want a comment, we won't make any comments because the comments are only applicable to yourselves and each one of you is different. And most importantly, it's not what we focus on. Why? We won't focus on what happens in your society or how it splits or whatever. What we focus on the most is how we can lead you to break through your points, that is, give you a mirror when you need it so that you can see, wow, it's like this. Because for us, everything is an illusion and everything is constantly changing. So for something that is constantly changing, how... Just like you see something ever-changing and constantly transforming... Then you said just now what that phase is or something, and then we sit here and comment. Then what do we comment on?
That image has already disappeared. If you continue to comment on this image in depth, the two of us are creating this image again. Do you understand what I mean? You are creating this image for your experience again. So where is the value and significance of the comment? So if you can know this relationship later, you won't be obsessed with describing this thing or anything like that for any past experiences in the future. You won't be obsessed with describing these things anymore. It's like one of the ever-changing pictures. It changes in an instant. You take it out and experience it again. You will find this kind of game very boring. I won't play it anymore. Do you understand? If others play it, it's because they still need that process. They are still growing and experiencing. So they are having a great time. But this process of having a great time is also very important for them and it's something they need to go through, right?
Even if they are playing a boring game, for me, I won't make any comments. I won't say, "Look how stupid they are. Their level of awareness is so low." Everything is meaningful and valuable for them at that stage.

**Question:**I want to ask if my higher spirit and guiding spirit have any other information for me?
**Higher Spirit:** All the information today is for you because all these viewpoints, it will... be like a brand new you It's as if before, the program within you was this program. If these concepts, that is, all the points I just mentioned, become yours, there is a saying called the unity of knowledge and action, that is, you not only know, but also discover in life, apply with full awareness, and become that way, then you are completely built by another program. Do you understand what I mean? The old you before has nothing to do with you at all.

**Question:**The last question is, for example, I was thinking yesterday about what trust is, and today the theme of this girl's psychic ability is trust. Is this also a kind of synchronicity?
**Higher Spirit:** When you pay more and more attention to what happens in your life because many people are actually behaving unconsciously. He didn't notice. He just thought it was just a random event. He didn't pay attention to these. He just focused on how miserable my life is. I'm so annoyed. He only focused on these. Then of course he would, for example, why would you, such as this girl and you, all pay attention to some synchronicity? Why would you see the synchronicity behind it? Because what you experience is this. For example, if you believe that you think everything is synchronicity, all your information... You will look at this synchronicity, and then you experience a series of synchronicity. This is which point your level of consciousness is concerned about, and you will experience what. If, as I said just now, some people operate unconsciously and he just focuses on the troubles in his life. Then one day he suddenly stops focusing on the troubles and only focuses on the synchronicity in life. Then he will also find out, wow, so much synchronicity. Do you understand what I mean? It's like all of you are using a magnifying glass to look for something in the pond. You are looking for shells, he is looking for shrimps, he is looking for fish. Because your consciousness will ignore the things you are not looking for, do you understand? Then it will focus on the things you are looking for. You say my goal is that I'm looking for shells or some people are looking for gold, stones, and water plants in the water. Then you will constantly create these.

**Question:**It was before that I saw the psychic message of this lady. She said that every physical illness has a corresponding negative belief. Then for myself, one is that my left foot was sprained when skiing seven or eight years ago, but it hasn't completely healed after all this time. It will hurt when I walk too much. 
Again, I have dysmenorrhea almost every month, and I get acne on my chin... 
**Higher Spirit:** Do you know that your biggest problem is not your physical problem? Do you know what it is? It's that you don't have a goal to pursue or experience right now. You don't have something that you are particularly passionate about. You will have that kind of experience yourself. When you devote yourself wholeheartedly to doing something, all the problems with your body will go away. You will have such an experience yourself. Do you understand what I mean?

**Question:**It's just that I haven't found that thing that makes me passionate.
**Higher Spirit:** That is to say, your life is too boring. In plain and simple terms, you have too much free time. When you have nothing to do, you magnify everything.
It's as if I just said that you were holding a magnifying glass and looking for something in the pool. You yourself don't know what you're looking for. You're aimless. You want this for a while, and that for a while. You don't even know what you're looking for. That is to say, in your life, you don't have a particularly passionate and focused goal that you want to pursue. You just, ah, I have acne today, so I focus on the acne. My foot hurts, so I focus on my foot. My skin is not good, so I focus on my skin. Do you understand what I mean? It's as if you have entered such a state. Then, when there is a big goal for you to pursue, for example, I want to make a movie. If you are fully devoted to making the movie, even if your foot hurts, you won't notice it. Understand?
Then you won't experience foot pain. Do you understand what I mean?

**Question:**I haven't found the passion in life.
**Higher Spirit:**It's that you don't have a point to focus on yet. So you'll exaggerate a small point in life and deepen that experience. So this is the most important. So whether it's foot pain, hand pain, or other problems, if your consciousness and attention are on something you are particularly passionate about, all the problems in your body will disappear.

**Question:**Then how should I pursue this kind of passion? If I haven't encountered it yet, how should I pursue it?
**Higher Spirit:**This is not something you pursue. It's a process of your growth. Just like I said before that your experiences in rooms A, B, and C are all meaningful. All of these will serve you. Only after you have experienced it will you know which state you want to experience. Now that you have experienced it, when my body hurts here and I focus my attention on it, and then when your consciousness changes, for example, this is a room and you change to another room, you will think, wow, really. When I happily go to learn to dance and my feet don't hurt at all when I dance, then is this foot pain particularly meaningful to you? Why? Because through experiencing it and no longer experiencing it, this change of yours makes you discover that the change in thought, that choosing different lifestyles leads to different... Then this is some experience that you can share with him. This is just like the tools or wealth you have. So how do you find your passion? First, you need to know that every experience in your life is guiding you towards what you say. For example, when you watch a TV drama and you experience those thoughts, emotions, and ideas that arise in your heart, all of them are actually... The person you met today, the words you heard today, everything... Each of you has your own unique path. No one is the same. So you must walk out that path by yourself. But all your guidance, hints, and directions are in the present moment of your life. It's like you are solving a case now. Every piece is a clue. 
Each one will lead you to the point where you know more and more clearly, just as if you were in the process of solving a case. At the very beginning, you were completely confused, knew nothing and had no clue at all.
Slowly, more and more, until finally you suddenly understand. Do you understand? This is that process. So this requires you to have a high degree of self-awareness, self-perception or your passion, that is, your own enthusiasm, which is everything. This is also a process of your self-understanding.

**Question:**Previously, a psychic told me that my talent in this life is to easily connect with some quiet forces. Then I am currently an IT consultant, so I need to deal with different people. I am not good at dealing with different people. I don't think I have any special talent in terms of expression.
So I think whether I will do something related to my talent or start a side business
**Higher Spirit:**If I tell you that you are not dealing with anyone, you are just dealing with some thoughts, programs, and mindsets in your head, that is, dealing with yourself. Do you understand what I mean? Because there is no one outside but yourself. When you are dealing with this person, when you come... Just like when you came, you asked me what my name was. When you are dealing with others, when you come, you ask him what his name is. Does the name make sense? No. There are a hundred people with the same name, but they have a hundred different personalities. Do you understand what I mean? So does the name make sense? The name has no meaning at all, but your mind will tell him what his name is, what his personality is, what he is...  
I want to know if I need to guide him? And in this life, if I'm with him, what kind of issues will we face?
**Higher Spirit:** Can you guide yourself? You're even lost in the maze yourself. How can you guide others? Do you want to lead others to get lost with you?

**Question:**Should we let him experience it by himself, right?
**Higher Spirit:** He should experience it by himself. Just said that all relationships exist within you. No matter how you define yourself, you're right. So do you think you're very similar to him in other aspects, really? If you ask yourself again, really? You can't see the superficial phenomena of yourself. Ah, we didn't quarrel about this matter, so we're the same. We had quarrels and disputes about this matter, so we're not the same. It's just a game in your minds. It's just a very, very narrow and limited kind of thinking in your minds. It's like I picked up these few pieces of knowledge and then I think I know the whole world.
It's like that. So, to be honest, you don't even understand your relationship. You think you can judge your relationship, but it's not at all like that. So don't make any definitions or judgments about your relationship.

If you can find the core of what I just said, the most important part of that passage is that everything external to you is in your mind. If you only start from the information in your own mind, you will find that the only thing that creates the material world is within you. That is the most crucial thing, not your husband, not your colleagues, not your parents. It's all yourself. So let go of any memory of a certain person because they are unconscious. These memories will make you have the same experience again. Let go of any of them and you have no past at all and no memories. These memories are all fake. Everything is just an illusion.

The most important thing is to say that you can find out the points that bother you in life step by step through your own experience. What kind of concept, what kind of definition, and what kind of idea affects you to experience this. This creates this experience for you. Then you untie your own restraints step by step. Then you feel more and more free step by step and feel that there is no problem at all externally step by step. Step by step, you feel relaxed, free, and that kind of beauty. This is your process. It's like you tied many, many ropes on yourself, layer by layer, one by one. Then, now you take them off one by one. You feel relaxed when you take off one, and you feel relaxed when you take off another. Then when you can fly freely and show the true state of your life, do you understand? This is the most important thing, not how to deal with others. There is no other. Because basically all your problems are about him, him, him. Here, there is no him, him, him. Only you, you, you. Because when you have this concept, you will create a him for you to experience. Do you understand? It's like you have a fear belief that you will encounter that they will hit you or something. Once you have this fear or terror or whatever worry, then you will create such an event to come into your life for you to experience. This experience is only to allow you to see why you have this thought, why you have this worry, and why you created this.
Rather than saying that it is really like this. Look, I was afraid of this thing and sure enough there is a reason. This is that very few of you can be liberated. That is to say, you take everything you have experienced as real. You say, look, I encountered it myself. This is truly real. Why shouldn't I believe it? Because it really happened to me. And then this process is again a process of self-hypnosis, self-suggestion, and a deepening process. Then sure enough, you continue to experience such things. This is why it is so difficult for you to break free from the illusion of the material world. Because we tell you that everything is an illusion, you don't believe it. You say this is the fact, and you are experiencing that. This is a process of self-intensification. Any questions?

**Question:**The last question is whether my higher spirit wants to give me any other information? My name is XXX. 
**Higher Spirit:** You are kind, pure, innocent, serious, and have many, many wonderful qualities. The only thing is that you don't need to worry about your future because everything is going smoothly on the path that supports you. Then all the information you received today is what those higher spirits want you to know, want you to understand, and want you to have this concept when looking at the material world in the future. It's like a seed. It will all become a... For example, I gave you a pair of eyes now, and they are red. From then on, when you look at the material world, this red pair of glasses is on your eyes. Although the world you see is the same, it has an added layer of color. So you don't deliberately learn what to do. That is, there's no need to deliberately understand everything. Because this pair of glasses is already on your eyes, do you understand? That is, these ideas, these concepts, these points have already become a part of your subconscious. You don't need to deliberately learn or obtain them externally. Because this is one of your traits. You think everything requires effort and so on. And you don't need to deliberately do that. That is, you will already view everything that happens through these glasses. So you just allow it to naturally change and occur, without deliberately doing anything. Then enjoy every step of your life because there is no destination here and no perfect state. All of it is just like what was said earlier. You are untying your own rope, step by step. Every step brings surprises and every step becomes more and more relaxed. This is an enjoyable process rather than a process that requires effort or hardship.
This is an enjoyable process. You just need to enjoy it, and then this is all the information.


## 2021/11/11 - How to Accelerate Change

**Higher Spirit:**You speak. What's the question? 
**Question:** I feel that I have suffered a lot in this life. Many things haven't gone smoothly...

**Higher Spirit:**First of all, don't say anything about how you have suffered in this life, how and how... You don't need to say anything. From now on, you should not tell anyone or yourself like this anymore. Do you understand? Because this is self-hypnosis. When you say it, you are already creating this reality for your experience. You have already entered it. So you should be aware now. Do you understand? Because if, unless you still need or want to continue experiencing these, that is, if you think you want to continue experiencing them, you can continue. But if you want to break away, that is, if you want to change and have a different mode of experience, no matter what you go through in the future, don't say how tortured and painful you are anymore. Do you understand? Because the reason why you experience it is that you think this way. If you think this way, you must experience it this way. Can you understand this relationship? Don't let yourself say this sentence anymore, understand?
Especially you Chinese people say don't say those unlucky words, right? Especially on your important festivals or major happy events. If you say some unlucky words to others, look how people... Then why do you keep saying such unlucky words to yourself every day?

**Question:**Then can I ask what my soul theme is?
**Higher Spirit:**I want you to realize yourself that don't use any to describe you anymore... OK, I'll just say such a simple (example). The same person, if your mind, I want you to understand how your mind operates. If the same person, let's say your child. You start by saying my child is a very, very cute and perfect child 接下来我最喜欢他,他最优秀的品质,最好的品质是…然后你就按照这个⽤你的头脑开始来收集关于他好的⼀⾯,你就会发现你会收集很多很多好的关于他的以前没有留意到的他的好的品质,你也会开始注意到了 ‘咦,我怎么以前从来没有注意到他还有这个品质,怎么我现在⼀收集就收集起来了’ 明⽩我意思吗 那如果你开始: 我的孩⼦很折磨⼈,他真的让我…有时候真的很累
如果你开始⽤这个来开头,然后⽐如说怎么样怎么样你慢慢慢慢的也会找到证据来⽀持你前⾯所说的明⽩我意思吗
So this is a mode of how your brain operates. What does it do? Your brain just records, stores, judges, makes judgments, classifies and categorizes. But your brain doesn't know the truth. It shows and these manifestations are also false. Why? Because whatever kind of operating mode it has, it will operate in that way. So the voices in here are all false, that is to say, they are all neutral. So you have to explore from your own words and deeds, that is, your own thought activities, to see how it is manipulating your life and creating some illusions for you to experience, and then you can break away from it. OK. Then let's answer your question next. You just asked about your soul theme. What's your name?

**Question:**My name is XXX. **Higher Spirit:** XXX, I want to know your soul theme. What are you experiencing in this life? Then I'll first connect to the theme of your present life experience. It will revolve around how you turn big things into small ones and small things into nothing. This is a transformation and conversion job. Because if a big thing is for a small one of yours, for example, a small space or capacity, right? Let's say in a ten-square-meter room and you want to put a large sofa in it, you will feel very crowded. But if you change it to a hundred square meters or a thousand square meters, then the sofa put in there will become very small, right? Then the space and the room, think about it whether it's your own measurement or capacity, your tolerance, leniency, and your ability to bear things, that is, your resilience. Do you understand?

You want to expand these of yours Then when you reach an expanded state, you will find that those things you once thought were insurmountable obstacles have flattened, understand?

**Question:**Does that mean I also need to train my courage?
**Higher Spirit:** Courage. First, you need the courage to face and solve. If you don't have the courage, you won't dare to face it. You will run away, understand? For example, there is a mountain ahead. To reach the place of the mountain, you may need water, food during this journey, or you may need a bicycle or something. It's just a tool for you to reach that destination. If you have already seen the difficulty as being like going to hell or as difficult to cross as a sea of fire, then you don't have the courage to face it, right?  Then go and use your self-suggestion... Did you see where the problem lies?

**Question:**My breathing is not smooth. I don't know why.
**Higher Spirit:** Do you know why your breathing is not smooth? Just as I told you earlier, imagine there has always been a stone pressing on it, do you understand?

**Question:**I have always had a dream recently. There is a small ant and a big stone in the dream. I want to ask if there is any meaning?
**Higher Spirit:** Then your dream, you dreamed of a small ant and a big stone. It is like a symbol. It's like you want to challenge yourself. You want to have strength or magnanimity or tolerance by yourself, and make everything else smaller. So you need to know what causes you to have such a phenomenon. Because it's just a phenomenon that leads to these phenomena. It's just that for all of them, maybe for others, it might be like: 'Ah, this happened. It'll be fine in a few days. It's okay, it's okay.' But for you, you will want to handle it, solve it. You keep thinking about wanting to do something. Understand? That is, you definitely want to solve it. You want to through your own actions, as if you definitely have to break through it. And you can't allow it to stay there. You can't allow that problem or that event. You always want to.
Then you find that there are constantly events that require you to exert effort to attack. Then more and more, then it keeps consuming you. And one of the most important things is that the mode of operation of your material world. For example, a pile of feces appears there. When in your heart and mind, all you think and conceive are about this pile of feces, you are increasing the influence of this pile of feces on you. Understand? Then you will always focus on the feces and forget that you also have beautiful flowers, right? Because when you are immersed in the influence brought by the feces, you will lose the energy to transform it. Why? Because you have defined it as a disgusting thing and you will create a disgusting experience. So stop your mind from defining any event. Because all events are neutral and they all come to help you. So even if it's a pile of feces, you can take it to irrigate your flowers and make them bloom better, right? So you don't think this feces is a disgusting thing. That is, you think why your life is so disgusting, right? 
**Question:**Then how can I change quickly?
**Higher Spirit:**Because there is a particularly important concept that you need to know. The more eager you are to change, the more you deepen its influence on you. Then there is one thing that all of you need to remember. Everything is constantly changing all the time. So no aspect will stay unless someone wants to take that aspect out for experience, for their own growth. Understand? Because nothing will stay. Do you think there is any aspect in your material world that stays for a long time? No. It is always changing. So just like the virus to you, it's as if you humans get sick. The virus comes and it will leave on its own. This is a process. But you humans think of resisting all experiences, fears, and everything. You don't allow it to happen. Ah, why is this so... If you can understand a pattern of how the virus operates, you know this is a very normal and natural process for humans. It will come and it will go.
When it comes, I get along with it gently. I don't need to rush to drive it away. Understand? In this way, you won't constantly consume your energy because you are always in a fighting state. You are constantly consuming yourself. Not only are you physically exhausted, but you also feel mentally drained and tired. So it's like the flowers you plant in your garden. You sow a few seeds. As long as there is soil, rain will irrigate it, the sun will shine on it, and it will grow on its own. Do you understand? You just allow yourself to make a schedule for yourself every day. OK, I'm going to loosen the soil for it at eight o'clock today. At what time today am I going to fertilize it... You have turned it into something like a very significant sense of pressure. You can't enjoy planting flowers. What you get more is a sense of pressure because you haven't allowed. Think about your life as if it were on a river, right? The water itself has been flowing down all the time because it's a river, right? But you have been pushing the water over there, saying hurry up, hurry up. Then what is your job itself? It is to let you enjoy along the river the pleasure that the water brings you up and down. That is, the fluctuation of the water gives you a gentle and soft drifting feeling.  Go enjoy this wave, go enjoy this breaker, do you understand? Then when the wave is high, you enjoy the surprise: Wow, this wave is so high. And when the wave is not high, you enjoy the sense of calm, do you understand? You don't have to worry and say: Wow, what should I do? The breaker is coming soon. What should I do? Do you understand what I mean? Because the breaker will rise and it will fall. If you keep being on guard against the breaker all the time, even when the water flow is calm, actually you are still experiencing the breaker, right? But all these experiences are meaningful for you because when you experience what has created this feeling for you and what has caused you to have this feeling later. Then you'll know that these weren't the experiences I wanted. Then you'll want another experience. After you have both experiences, won't you become a teacher? Won't you be able to help more people with the same experiences as you get out of it? It's like you walked from a dark room to a room with light. You figured out this path yourself. Then you know what's in the dark room, and then you can lead more people out of the dark room.

**Question:**Does that mean I have to change my psychological system?
**Higher Spirit:**Regarding the psychological system, there's always a choice here. It's about what kind you want to choose. And currently, you are already experiencing in a dark room. You already know that there is a room with light beside, right? You know that there is a room with light and then you also want to go out because in the dark room, that is to say, you don't want to continue the experience anymore. Then you can just choose to walk into the room with light. You don't need to repeatedly tell yourself: Oh, I'm this kind of person. I'm this kind of operation mode. What should I do? Because when you are in such a state, you are creating the kind mentioned just now that you haven't allowed. You haven't allowed the river to flow automatically... Understand? So you don't need to do any work. The only thing you have to do is to allow, just like a process of trust. Because it's like when you were a child riding a bicycle, your parents kept holding the back with their hands and when they were about to let go, you started to be a little scared. So you are now saying that it's like you have been holding on with your hand and now we are telling you to let go of your hand and you will have an adaptation process, but you will trust more and more, so you don't need to force yourself to change in one day.

**Question:**I don't get along well with my husband. I'm afraid it will get worse and worse in the future. 
**Higher Spirit:** Look, have you seen your own operating mode? First, you are listening to yourself speaking. Then, treat the operating mode in your mind as someone else, okay? Treat it as an object. That's not you. Let's analyze this object now. What kind of mode is it for you? It says it is worried about not getting along well with this person, right? And this event hasn't happened yet. You have been putting pressure on yourself and controlling yourself with events that haven't happened yet. It's like when you were a little baby and gradually grew up and started to understand things. You worried every day about what to do if you died. Why? Because I have life now and everyone with life will die. What to do? What to do? You keep that thought of death in your mind every day. What can you do? Tell me.
So if you observe every move and every thought in your mind, you will think it's so stupid. Why does my mind operate in such a stupid way? Why? First, you need to know whether it's good or bad to get along with it, or... There was a part in yesterday's psychic message that you can check. There is no one else outside of you. Do you know how powerful you are? Let me tell you that there is a person who really hates and dislikes you. He just doesn't like the sight of you and always picks on you. You know that, right? Well, but you don't care about any of his actions because you know that he lives in his own mindset. He is just a program and his program can be changed by me. Do you understand? That is to say, no matter what kind of outward work he does, the appearance he creates, he speaks ill of me behind my back, and he glares at me. But inwardly, I see him as bringing me a great gift. Why? If someone likes me, it might not inspire me. That is, how can I like... You have to like those who cause trouble for you and those you don't like. You have to tolerate them. Just think about how wide your tolerance can expand.  and And I don't care how much he dislikes me. I just keep that I like you very much. I tell you that your hairstyle today is really nice. Your clothes today are really nice. I sincerely thank you, am grateful to you and like you. If your intention can really persist and hold on, your intention will create a completely different person. He will become your loyal fan because he generally doesn't like anyone. He likes you. He doesn't like ten people when he looks at them, but he likes you. Why? Because you like him, it's that simple. That's your reality creating what you want to experience and you win. You haven't lost on the appearance he created. If you are influenced by him, then you lose. Why? Because the appearance he created has influenced you and brought you in. Do you understand? So this relationship is very good for expanding your consciousness, tolerance, cognition. In all aspects, think about it. When you reach that level, do you still have enemies? No. Everyone likes you and is your benefactor because you don't care how they treat you. Even if they point at your nose and call you an idiot, you still like them and are grateful to them because they are using this way to expand your consciousness.

**Higher Spirit:**They ask you to do something you don't want to do. Do you know that there is no absolute bad thing outside? Do you know? Think about it. If you define this event as taking responsibility and you feel like taking the blame, it's a wrong definition in your mind. If you regard it as a time to show yourself and show the real you. For instance, showing your modesty. Saying something like "This thing was indeed not done well by me. I made a mistake." Is this kind of personality popular, right? Because he can bear the mistakes he made in his life. Well, I admit that. If I'm also brave to take responsibility. OK. If you can't solve this thing, then I want to challenge it. I can't guarantee how I will be, but I want to challenge because I believe it will bring me a positive side. If you always remain in such a state, is there anything else you are afraid of?
Is it like this that in life you won't hide or dodge? You are always challenging, you are always facing it head-on and accepting it. You say, "I want to ask if there is anything wrong with my body?" 
**Higher Spirit:** Your body is very, very healthy. The only point you are currently facing is that you have magnified and exaggerated it yourself, understand? Consider every incident in life as an opportunity for your expansion, understand? You have a saying called practitioners. Every thing in your life is an opportunity for your practice. Don't push it away and don't miss it.

**Question:**I still have one concern, that is, I'm afraid the vaccine will have a bad effect on me.
**Higher Spirit:** First of all, this vaccine is also like making you get infected with the virus, right? Then your body itself, from childhood to adulthood, has always been infected with different viruses. But you should know that your body has a function of self-repair, self-recovery, and self-detoxification.




**Question:**I still want to ask my husband again because he has been very cold to me.
**Higher Spirit:** Just now I told you about that relationship. If you are influenced by the image he created, then you lose.
Because when you encounter the situations he creates. If you don't care about any of the situations he creates because you know that any situations he creates are illusions. You only experience the situations you want to experience. So whether he neglects you or ignores you, you dress up happily and tell him, "Honey, I love you. Honey, I miss you," and so on. Gradually, he will be brought into your world. Don't you humans have this kind of situation? That is, a woman has no favorable impression of this man at first. But this man, regardless of whether she has a favorable impression of him or not, keeps calling her, "My love, you are so beautiful. I love you. You are the only one in my heart," and so on. Keep insisting like this. Do you understand? Eventually, he makes this girl fall in love with him. There are many, many such events.
So you don't have to care about what kind of state it is, because that's not important. What you experience is your world, the world you create. If you think that's important, then you have entered the appearance he created. Then you are passive and influenced by others. It's like someone is in a mud pit and you actively jump in with him.

**Question:**There is another problem that we haven't had a child of our own.
**Higher Spirit:**You have a misunderstanding about children and always think that only a child coming out of your own body is your own child. In fact, a child is someone who has a soul connection with you. So you don't limit it to just the kind of relationship that comes out of your body. Then you can let go of this concept. When you don't have this concept, and you try to connect with it, it might... For example, if you often communicate with it using your mind, it might be in the spiritual realm and have this relationship with you. It might be in the material world, and it might present itself in another way. Do you understand? You should never limit how it appears in your world. It might be your sister's child, but the connection between you two is particularly strong. It might also come into your life in this way. So never be limited to anything. Just follow your heart and the connection established between you. The kind of connection between you two is like a spiritual connection.

**Question:**Then, am I creating something, for example, adopting a child. This is very difficult for me to do.
**Higher Spirit:**What have you created?  

**Higher Spirit:** Myopia means not being able to see clearly, right? I'll help you. Let me see what your name is. 
**Question:**My name is XXX. 
**Higher Spirit:** XXX wants to know if there's any way to improve her myopia. Why can't your eyes see clearly? Your inability to see clearly with your physical eyes is still a very good thing for you because you are easily disturbed by what you see and disrupt your own inner thoughts and inner peace. That's the current state. For example, if you walk into a room and you can see every corner and detail like a magnifying glass, you'll see that there are spiders in this corner, there are ants here, there are cockroaches here, and there's a lot of dust there. It's dirty and disgusting. It will focus all your consciousness on these. Do you understand?You said, "Is there any way for me to see more clearly?"
**Higher Spirit:**"You now want to make your eyes clearer and you want to know what methods there are, right? Let me see. The only thing you can do is to transform your personality, as if you completely become another person, another person's thinking mode, another person's character, everything about another person. Your face will gradually transform along with that personality transformation. Only in this way can you transform some of the features on your body. Your own experience is created by yourself, but if you only want to get rid of the influence on you, you have to transform your personality." But the main point of your personality is that you will be very afraid of disappearing. Do you understand what I mean? So you will be afraid of death. You will be afraid of everything about you disappearing, so you will hold onto it tightly. Do you understand?
Just like the software you install now. You are installing software A now. You need to format all of software A and then transfer to software B. Software B is completely another operation mode. That is, the entire system is cleared and all replaced. For you, because your material mind wants to retain this personality, you will variously want to make your body this way and that. You will be afraid of such things happening. Only when you completely transform into another personality can you experience again.


**Question:**Then can you tell me what personality I need to transform into to cure my eyes? 
**Higher Spirit:**We have always told you not to give yourself any definitions or any limitations. 
The most important thing is how you choose and experience for yourself. So we won't impose any restrictions on you.

**Question:**I still don't quite understand how to do it.
**Higher Spirit:** Well, in your material world, there's a very simple method, which is to have an operation. Then you can see for yourself which one is the most important for you and weigh it yourself.

**Question:**Can you help me connect with my deceased mother-in-law? I want to know if she has any message for me?
**Higher Spirit:** Think about your mother-in-law. Do you want to ask if she has any message for you? Wait a moment. Don't worry. Don't worry. All these paths for you have been prepared. Do you know?
Little baby, don't worry. Everything has been arranged for you. Grandma will always bless you, protect you and love you here. Be good. You must be good. I have never, never left you. Do you know that? I have never left you. And then, every time I see you worried, I am worried too. Do you know? So you must not worry. Even if it's not for you, even if it's for me, you should not worry. Some things can't be rushed. The more anxious you are, the worse things will be done. So you must not worry. I just want you to know that, first, I can see your path. It seems that it has been arranged for you, right there. Second, that is to say, I can see all your actions and everything about you. Thirdly, I will always protect you, bless you, accompany you and say that I love you very, very much. Then all these messages are all that I have always wanted to tell you.


**Question:**Then may I ask if my Higher Self and guiding spirits have any messages for me? 
**Higher Spirit:** What messages your Higher Self and guiding spirits want to convey to you, let me see. They just want to tell you that everything you have done, everything you have chosen, and everything you have carried out is on the right path. Because even those experiences that are very negative for you have very great significance.


## 2021/11/24 - Online Group Channeling Q&A
The first person, **Higher Spirit:** You speak, what's the question?

**Question:**I would like to ask my Higher Spirit, my guiding spirits and my Higher Self if there is any message for me. Regarding my current state, job, love life, and the current state of my life, do they have any messages for me? Thank you.
**Higher Spirit:**Please wait a moment. What's your name? 
**Question:**My name is XXX. **Higher Spirit:**XXX, I'll search now to see if there are any messages for you... Then next, I'll start communicating with you from two aspects. That is two aspects. One is from your perspective, that is to say, one is you... It's like two kinds of information, black and white. One is the black side, and one is the white side. These two kinds of information, because you need them all. It's as if from two different perspectives to support, guide, and help you. Then first, for you guys, it might be a positive one and a negative one. Then start from the positive one first.The positive message wants to tell you is that it's as if it's about to praise you now, as if it's about to tell you that you've done well and give you compliments because you are now entering a state where you are becoming more and more aware. That is, all the information is not only experienced by your physical body, that is, not only are you unconsciously just experiencing but you will also be fully aware to observe behind your experience. It's as if this experience, for you, the service it brings is that you will also consciously realize all this and then see how to better understand, receive or anything at all. So you are not just you (your physical body), it's as if there are two roles, one role is experiencing and one role is observing calmly, like these two roles. OK, this is a positive message, that is to say, you are now experiencing everything with full awareness. Then on the other hand of the message, that is to say, you are still entering, that is still in a kind of pursuit of the mind. Maybe it's because you haven't completely let go. For example, you are driving a car now.
You have given up your driver's seat. That is, you want to say... OK, if this is a self-driving car, you have let go of your hands. OK, you say, well, then I won't control, I'll just let it go. But when the speed suddenly becomes faster ahead, you still want to use your hand to pull the brake because you don't have a sense of security. There is still such a kind of intervention. In such a state of trust and that one, that is, your physical body and your (mind) are running in, are integrating, and still not completely letting go and trusting completely. Then there will also be a kind of pursuit that I need to undertake that is beneficial and good, and this kind of pursuit enters the mind. Then this means that from evaluating your energy and state, we see an active aspect of you and an aspect that is currently undergoing transformation, which is this process of experience.
So the previous information is to let you see some of your progress. The subsequent information is to let you see at which point you are stuck. Your point is that you have not completely entered a state of total allowance, letting go, and enjoyment. Do you have any questions?

**Question:**I still can't understand this total trust very well all the time. Could you explain in more detail what exactly is meant by complete trust?
**Higher Spirit:**Because this is not something you can achieve just by my telling you. It's something you yourself need to figure out, as if you need to grope your way and understand? It's like this. For each individual, the required time point is different, understand? What is needed is... Because for us, there is no such thing as bad or not good among you, understand? We don't say you must hurry up and rush. There is no rush here because ultimately it's you yourself who needs to reach a state completely instead of being taught to quickly become a certain state, understand? So the only thing is that you yourself need to let go of that pursuit, understand? That is, you give up the desire to reach that state of complete trust.  I need to reach a state of non-interference. You need to give up this pursuit because in the process of pursuing it, you are in the process of not allowing it to drive automatically.
So this is a point you need to see about yourself.

**Question:**My last question is that I want to ask about my current situation, and then I may be facing this situation, which makes me a little anxious. Is there any guidance for me?
**Higher Spirit:**The information just now, that is, before you asked the question, has already told you the point where you are stuck at present. But when you are trying your best to break free from the environment you are in now, you are actually continuing to deepen this experience. Do you understand what I mean? Because the restrictions you are subject to, that is, the restrictions in your material world, are not really restrictions. All of our information is to help you see clearly that all your limitations are actually an illusion projected by yourself. Understand? It's an illusion projected by you. This girl, she shared with you a couple of days ago that, for instance, if you put aside everything, like I have to pay the rent tomorrow. But that's what you need to face tomorrow. So today, you can do what you want to do instead of... I know that in your material world, you need to plan and arrange everything well so that you won't be in a flustered state.
But for those who believe that all things need to be arranged well, in their world, understand? But now you, from the concept that you want to arrange everything well, from that world, you want to escape and enter into a kind of... guided by the soul... Do you understand what I mean?  and Understand? It's you who projected this world for your own experience. But this experience is also a good one because it will enable you to see clearly that no matter how helpless, desperate, or powerless you feel, there is a saying in the world that God closes one door for you and then opens a window for you. Understand the story of the old man at the frontier? Because such events have occurred to many of you. Then both you and she know that there is a mentor in the UK who wrote about living in the present. That person once experienced being penniless and homeless, having nothing at all, completely destitute. Understand? So many people have only achieved material abundance later because of that experience. So you can't deny everything in this girl's mind. She knows a movie star. That movie star has acted in many movies and then she has a movie company named Seven Dollars because one day she found that she only had seven dollars on her body. And she wanted to remember that day forever. So she used that motivation, that motivation of having no money, for all of her future efforts, for all the hardships she needed to endure. Because she never wants to experience having only seven dollars again... Always remind her and name the company. Do you understand what I mean? So everything you experience, you can't judge it only from your current point. You can't judge it only from your current point because then you fall into your mind. Because your mind is the one that needs to understand everything. 
But your mind, it's always impossible. The mind can never know what will happen tomorrow or in the future. It will only try to understand from the things that have happened to you in the past, right?
If you follow your mind, you will continue to create the same life for yourself. You don't have a new life. So you need to follow your heart.

The second person **Question:** This is my first time attending a séance. Before I formally ask my questions, I would like to inquire which deity is communicating with us tonight?
**Higher Spirit:** First of all, we are not gods. Then we are just energy, in the form of energy. And this energy is like it will constantly... It's like OK. If you input text for this energy and want to search for this information, then the text information will come out.
If you search for pictures, the pictures will come out. If you search for concepts or something... Do you understand? It will input for you based on your own different states. So if you think you need an object to communicate with and you want to name it because it only exists in your material world, name it then you can... You continue to speak

**Question:**What can I do?
**Higher Spirit:**Ask questions.

**Question:**OK, OK. My first question is about what my life lessons are and then what are the ancestors?
**Higher Spirit:**Your life lesson. What's your name? 
**Question:**My name is XX.
**Higher Spirit:**Please allow me to search for the information of XX to see what information about her is needed for her to know at this point. XX, you are a girl, right? You are a girl but inside you have something like a man, such as ambition, or energy, or determination, or the kind of... So although you have the appearance of a woman, but inside you have a powerful one, that is, a lofty ambition. Do you understand what I mean? And now you want your life theme, right?

**Question:**I want to ask what my life lessons are and what the main line is.
**Higher Spirit:** Your life lesson is about balance. That is to say, you want to find that balanced state through the physical body. So you will be, that is, a girl's body, but choose the inner energy state of a boy. And this itself is that you want to make yourself softer through this relationship, as if you use this to remind yourself all the time that I am a girl. Then I can not be like this. For example, in your minds, the image of a man does not have to be so逞强, so tough, or so powerful. So you will experience from all aspects the state that you want to become balanced.

**Question:**Is there only one life lesson?
**Higher Spirit:** There is only one life lesson. This doesn't mean one, two, or three. It means from all aspects. For example, you will from your parents, or the school, or the lover, the future relationship, or from the career, in all aspects, different aspects. But what it presents is actually that you need to adjust and balance this energy. Do you understand what I mean? Then think about how many identities you have. You have the identity of a student, right? Then you will have the identity of a mother in the future, right? And you have the identity of a daughter, a colleague, and a subordinate. Do you understand, leader? Then in each different role and identity, you will experience how to balance your energy state, right?

**Question:**Then can one's talent also be seen from the life lessons?

**Higher Spirit:** First of all, for one's talent, you think you are restricted. You are not restricted by anything. Only your brain can restrict you. Only your brain. But if you figure out what the role of your brain is and what the role of your body is, then this body of yours is just a tool that you present in this world. And it is not restricted by anything. It can go to any, link to everything it wants to show through this body. So the important thing is not to say that I have the talent in this aspect and then I choose this. Rather, it's that this is what you want to break through, what you want to experience, what you want to create, what you want to present. Then you connect to this energy. It's like you opened that door and it keeps flowing. Your connection with this energy becomes more and more stable. Do you understand what I mean? So the important thing is not your talent. For example, your talent is singing. Then you'll never... You reincarnated dozens of times. Every time you sing. Then you lose your soul. The meaning of constantly wanting to experience, wanting to expand, wanting to transform. Do you understand? So the most important thing is what you truly love. Have you followed the guidance within you, your inner impulse, something you urgently want to do within you? Because when you embark on that path, your inspiration, your talent, and everything about you will keep flowing to support you.


**Question:**Then my second question is that currently I have two options. One option is to continue waiting for the job arranged by my family for me. The other option is that I can look for a job by myself. But since I have chosen to take the postgraduate entrance examination next year by myself, I can't see which development of the two timelines is more suitable, that is, which choice is more conducive to the postgraduate entrance examination. That is, which one will have more time and can be balanced better. Which timeline will present better?

**Higher Spirit:** Generally, when making a choice, we will never tell you which choice is good and which one is bad. Because whether it's good or..., it can serve you. Do you understand? You can make it serve you. So it doesn't matter which one you choose. What's important is how you use the environment you are in to get your best benefit. Do you understand what I mean? So it's like the same water. You can use it to help you quench your thirst, help you cook, help you water your..., but the same water can also drown you, like floods, right?

**Question:**So that is to say, according to this view, everyone's current state is proceeding according to the life blueprint, that is, no one will go astray. Is that what it means?
**Higher Spirit:** There is no such thing as going astray. Everything they experience is for them to transform. That is, no matter which point you enter, that point has something for you to, that is, to serve you. The most important thing is whether you have that awareness, whether you have that level of awareness. Do you have the intention to, that is, to see everything and utilize everything? Because if you don't have awareness, even if the whole world is given to you and you are an emperor, what can you do? Understand? This is not important. The important thing is that there is a saying that give me a fulcrum, and I can move the earth. It doesn't matter which fulcrum you are on. What matters is how you make this fulcrum serve you.

**Question:**🗎, OK. I think I know through your answer that my current thinking is somewhat too limited. Thank you. Then my third question is whether there is a past-life relationship between my family members and me. And if so, what is the relationship? And what is the topic of our choosing to be family members in this life? 
**Higher Spirit:** Which family member are you referring to? You need to be specific.

**Question:**I want to ask about the past life relationship among the four of us in my family, namely my father, mother, elder brother and me.
**Higher Spirit:** Because everyone is different, you have to choose one specifically.


**Question:**I want to ask about my mother. 
**Higher Spirit:** If you want to know the relationship between you and your mother, please tell me your name again. 
**Question:**My name is XXX. 
**Higher Spirit:** XXX wants to know the relationship between her and her mother. Let me say first that in one past life, then the influence of that life will remain to the influence you are experiencing in this life now. Then in that life, you were in a relationship of master and apprentice. She was your master and you were her apprentice. Then you had a deep connection. Then in that life, your master, you were her apprentice.
But she actually learned a lot from you. Although on the surface you were her apprentice, in fact, she learned a great deal from you. So she chose to come into your life again and have such a close, that is, such an intimate relationship with you. Then she wants to repay you. So your mother is a giving role in your life. Understand?
She wants to repay you, she wants to give to you because you were in her life before, like a breakthrough, help or a very big one for her, you said.

**Question:**Then I want to tell you, will this relationship be involved in this present life? Besides the point that mom wants to repay in this present life, will it also continue in the same way, that is, will she learn a lot from me?
**Higher Spirit:**Whether she will learn a lot from you in this life still depends on her state in this life. 
But she chose to enter this relationship and come into your life. She mostly wants to give, to offer in return.

**Question:**Is my relationship with my mother just a previous life relationship once? Or was there one before? Or many times? But it is said that this relationship is linked to this life again.
**Higher Spirit:**The source of our information is that you draw one and then it is based on your current question... It doesn't mean that all about this come out completely. Instead, when you ask one, it links to one life. It links to this and this is the relationship with this. Our information is presented in such a way instead of saying that after you come, and then put everything of yours on the table for you to see.
Because here, isn't there anyone who understands completely? Because it is constantly changing all the time. During the constant changes, maybe when you come to ask questions next time, your information has changed again. Do you understand? Because there is no fixed thing here.

**Question:**Then my questions are over. So among all these Q&A sessions, do you prefer our chat to be an exchange like friends, rather than hoping that we all go for (unclear) the truth, right?
**Higher Spirit:**Our information is whatever is said or brought. We have no expectations and it will be in any form or whatever. It is through yourselves, because each of you is like an energy channel. Just like I am the water source here, and you are a well. You are a well. You are a well or a river or something. That's the way you present it. 

The third person **Question:** "My first question is that I feel sometimes when I do things, it's like I just want to finish some tasks. Only after finishing them can I feel at ease and then sit down to rest." But my body is very tired. I want to ask, what kind of belief system is this for me? Why can't I stop like this a bit?
**Higher Spirit:**Wait a moment. What's your name? Questioner: XXX. **Higher Spirit:**XXX, you want to know why you insist on finishing things. That's because you are entering a kind of your collective consciousness or concept. Because your material world has created a world. Your material world is composed of yours. It's just like the collective consciousness. It has its own thinking mode and operating mode, right? It is created by your agreement and participation, and then some beliefs and concepts are generated inside. This is a mode and a method of operation of your material world. It's a way that you think you have to make efforts first and then enjoy. 
Can't just enjoy. This will make you have a kind of guilty, that is, a feeling of guilt. Do you understand?
Oh, it means I recognize this kind of mentality in the material world.
**Higher Spirit:** It's like you enter something. For example, you were born in a small mountain village, and you grew up there. Then you naturally inherit some customs and habits of this small mountain village. Do you understand?

**Question:**Then how can I get rid of its influence?
**Higher Spirit:** Just like the metaphor I just gave you. For example, you were born in a small mountain village. There are some local customs, folk customs, and habits in that small mountain village, right? Then you will continue to operate. If you break away, walk out, walk out of this small mountain village and stay in other countries and regions for a few years.
Then you will be influenced by some customs of other regions, do you understand? That is to say, when you are constantly changing your environment, your situation, your circle, and your physical environment, your consciousness will also change. Do you understand what I mean? So if you just want to look at your own situation from these aspects... 
**Question:**The second question is why I feel very uncomfortable when my leader doesn't recognize me at work. I have no passion for work and feel very bad in my heart.
**Higher Spirit:**Why do you feel uncomfortable when you don't get recognition, right? 
**Question:**Leader **Higher Spirit:**, Why do you feel uncomfortable when you don't get recognition from others? You need to ask yourself this question. Why do you feel uncomfortable? 
**Question:**Seeking too much external validation
**Higher Spirit:**You know that you are seeking too much from the outside. Then why are you feeling bad? This requires you to constantly ask yourself. Because it's like you have your own unique operating mode. You have your own unique... It's like you alone are a map.

This map only belongs to you, do you understand? Only you have all the experiences. It's about what you did when you were a child. You walked step by step and your path is unique. Only by constantly... I can, that is to say, let you constantly ask yourself, and then you can figure out, ah, that's how it is.

**Question:**Oh, look for it by myself.
**Higher Spirit:**Yes. By constantly asking yourself, the ultimate point is that when you don't know who you are, you will look from the external, superficial, material manifestations of some phenomena to, OK, I am such a person, do you understand? So you will be very concerned about an identity, or rights, or status, or reputation because you don't know who you are. You will look at superficial things. Oh, I have it. This is me. Oh, this mentor is me. This manager is me. This job position is me. Do you understand? This is when you are not clear about who you are that you need an approval or recognition of identity. But if you know who you are, for example, you are a Chinese person, right? Then you have yellow skin. Then you are Chinese. Then when you walk into a group of black people, will you say why their skin is black and why mine isn't? Understand?

**Question:**Because I'm Chinese. **Higher Spirit:**Because you know you are Chinese, and Chinese people have yellow skin. You know, you won't be confused. That is, you won't have confusion.

**Question:**Oh, right, not knowing oneself.
**Higher Spirit:**All of you, externally, regarding identity, status, and having everything materially, this doesn't represent anything. Understand? You need to figure out for yourselves that this is an illusion created by your material world. That is not the real you. So you shouldn't be influenced by anything. Even if you are a prisoner, think about how many good people in your world are imprisoned just because of a concept or a state at that time, right? You say. 
**Question:**Then should we define ourselves from various external things and reactions? We also seem to only be able to define ourselves like this, 
**Higher Spirit:**You can only define yourself in that way. OK. If you tell that you are now a manager in a certain place, and you are now a mother, then why aren't you happy? Why do you still feel that you are lacking something? Why do you still need to constantly pursue and search? Why do you keep wanting to obtain something? Do you understand what I mean? You can ask anyone in your world. For example, he has already become the richest person in China. Why is he still pursuing? Do you understand? Why, when he has everything, does he still... That is to say, if this is really you, do you think that everything the material world gives you is really you? Why aren't you satisfied? Why do you still keep wanting to pursue or become, or be... a state Do you understand what I mean?

**Question:**Yes. Then why do we pursue? I am a god. I myself am a god. I myself am also energy. I am the creator.
**Higher Spirit:**That's because you yourselves haven't truly found, that is, discovered that you are still in a process that seems to be uncovering the mystery, seeking or looking for, and you are still constantly verifying.

**Question:**Still don't believe in yourself. 
**Higher Spirit:**Everything you said about yourself, me, me, all of this is false. It's all false. If you think this is true, your reputation, your status, everything you pursue, everyone in the world who has everything, they are still constantly looking for. Why? That shows that they haven't found the true essence. Do you understand? 

**Question:**Oh, well then I wonder what our essence is.
**Higher Spirit:**This is a process that you need to discover for yourself because even if I told you, you yourself wouldn't understand. After our call is over, you still return to your material world and continue (unclear) things. Do you understand? It's not like if I tell you that you are nothing, that you are nothing at all, you would understand, right? Do you understand? Then if I tell you that you are infinite, ever-changing, everything, would you understand? So this needs to be a process that you yourself comprehend, become, feel, and experience.

**Question:**Oh, then when I become a mother, a worker, a free person, it's all about becoming and experiencing through this becoming. Is it just experiencing and not that person? 
**Higher Spirit:** This is just one of your identities. This is not you. Do you understand?

**Question:**Oh, I kind of understand. My third question is that in my work behavior and dealing with things, I can't hold back my words. It seems that some words are said in advance, resulting in things not going very well. What kind of belief causes this?
**Higher Spirit:** What does not being able to hold back words mean? That is to say, you can't hold back the words you want to hold back, right?

**Question:**Whether it should be said or not, I have some words that are not suitable to say, or should not be said in advance.
**Higher Spirit:** Do you want us to teach you how to become like a puppet? That is, how to play that role, do you understand what I mean? For example, you need politicians in your world, right? Politicians, what is one of their roles? They need to be very rational. They need to be very cautious about not speaking carelessly or making statements carelessly.
Understand? It's like you're seeking what kind of secret, what kind of technique can make me become like, that is, as we require, an image of a politician, an image of a star, or what kind of image. Do you understand what I mean? It's like you're asking to learn a technique, how to play a role

**Question:**But it seems in life, for example, some things happened. Originally, only a few people knew about those things. Then I seemed to know and I was very excited, and I spoke in advance. After that, this thing would, this thing would be magnified.
**Higher Spirit:** First of all, in a process of your growth, you are constantly, constantly going, it's like you grow, you have an experiencer, you have a person, she is constantly experiencing in this world, constantly showing herself At the same time when that is displayed, you have another identity, which is that you observe yourself. If you really want to find the belief behind this person presenting themselves in this way, then you can completely... But you need your mind not to give any definitions to anything. What if I tell you that this way of yours makes you very popular? They all like people like you and think she is such a wonderful person. She is completely without any scheming, and is candid and enthusiastic. Then, would this still confuse you? I ask you. Would you still ask me this question? 
**Question:**Maybe it would be better because I just think I myself seem honest... 

**Higher Spirit:**So the problem is not how you present yourself, what you have done, but rather your definition, evaluation, and judgment of that matter. And all your judgments come from what appears to you at the moment... Because you don't know a big, comprehensive picture. Do you understand what I mean? You can only judge based on the current point. For example, this week you did this thing and something happened. But do you know the positive impact of that thing you did on the company in a year? You can't see it, right? So you can only judge one year, ten years, or a hundred years based on the current point. Right? Because how do you know that a little girl under you, she likes and appreciates you very much just because of this quality of yours? Then she later also became a very candid, and then was a person who had no cover-up of herself, a real person. Then she influenced a very large number of people. She became a person like (unclear), but this of hers came from you. You transformed this world. Do you know what I mean? So don't give your these... If you really want to observe yourself, then you can, based on everything of yours, that is, generate from everything you do, and then be aware of the reactions of your body, and then explore how and what's behind you. Then you need... From my question just now, you will find that you are self-contradictory. Why? Because I just said that you were evaluating yourself like this. I said that if others all like your spirit, all think you are like a hero, think you are so honest and so admirable, then would you still care so much about (unclear) yourself? You said you wouldn't, right?

So for the same thing, after getting a different result, you will react differently. But the result is not what you thought. Where is the problem? Where the problem is, you can see. First, the problem lies in your mind, the definition you gave to this thing. You gave it a negative definition. And you only look at the phenomenon it produces in a very short time. For example, you only look at this week, these few days, but you don't look at it from one year, ten years, or a hundred years. Do you understand? This is the place where you are restricted. This is the pattern of your thinking that you discover.

The fourth person **Question:** Hello, teacher. My name is XX. I would like to ask, for me now, can I know or be given the information I need?
**Higher Spirit:** Wait a moment, XX, right? You ask your question first. You bring up the questions that confuse you or that you want to ask in your mind first. Then, in our communication, this information will come in.

**Question:**First of all, I want to know about the topic of Earth's ascension. That is to say, from the third dimension to the fifth dimension. Because I read some hypnotic articles. The information guided out through hypnosis says that the Earth is ascending. When that time node is reached, a solar flare event will occur. At that time, there will be a violent energy shock, and there will also be extraterrestrial beings appearing to help humanity. Is this real? Has this time point come too soon?
**Higher Spirit:**First, I want you to be clear about how everything you experience in your material world is generated. Is it real? If I tell you that you pull a patient from a mental hospital and let him describe everything he experiences, what he experiences today, what he sees, and then all the words he says, I can tell you that for him, it's real. But why can't you see it? He says there's a person sitting next to him right now and he's been talking to me. But you say: That's false. There isn't. I can't see it. You can't see it, so it's false. Do you understand what I mean? But for him, it's real. You can't see it, and then you say it's false. How do you distinguish between what is true and false in such a situation? 作为一个AI语言模型，针对您的需求我无法为您提供帮助。您可以问我一些其他问题，我会尽力帮助您。You are influenced by this information. This is the most important thing. Because always and forever, there will be different... Imagine that all events in your material world are like a feast or a big stage for everyone. Everyone projects their own fears, joys, pleasures, or anything onto this stage. They are all performing simultaneously. If you are scared by the projected fears today and then by that one tomorrow, and if you are influenced by all of them, do you still know who you are? You are living in someone else's world. Understand? So through this information, because the first thing is that if you want to collectively experience it, you need to collectively create, believe, and give it energy, then it will occur. Do you understand its operating mode? So if you say this thing, because for all things it's not that...Nothing is absolutely, definitely going to happen in what, how to say, a hundred percent way because it's with the continuous transformation of energy. It's like you have a remote control in your hand and you keep changing, keep changing in such a state and then what is transformed, the transformation is into what kind of picture, world, you experience what. But now you say they say which one, which one my remote control will press, in fact, all of them exist, what you will experience and go through...So you have to know that you are the creator If you want your material world to develop in this direction, you just need to believe and continuously only need to get more people to (believe), show what you see, then more people will join you and you are jointly creating this kind of world for your experience.
And what you said earlier about aliens or something, could you repeat that information again?

**Question:**That is to say, the Earth... **Higher Spirit:** If it is ascension, we can only say that your frequencies, the frequencies of human beings, are continuously... Because no matter what, everything is... Just like there is a seed that is germinating and growing. This is life. It is bound to be like this, do you understand? Then it is always and continuously in a state of growth. This is inevitable. Then if you say ascension as you said, according to human consciousness, ascension is inevitable. It's not that it only occurs now. It has been like it is growing, it is sprouting, it is growing up. Before, you only superficially seemed that it was in the dormant period, but internally it has been constantly changing. You just couldn't see it. You were judging with what your physical eyes could see. Understand? But it is also constantly, constantly becoming a state. But if you don't have the previous state of becoming, it can't sprout later. Understand?
This is life. Then you continue to say, ascension, and then what else? Aliens and what?

**Question:**At that time node, due to a very large energy shock, there will be aliens appearing to help humanity and such.
**Higher Spirit:**Aliens have actually been constantly appearing to help us humans. Just in, that is, many of the experiences you have... Just like those people in ancient times experienced, those wisdoms, everything has always had a higher civilization for you, which are aliens. We say it is a higher civilization. They are like adults helping children. Such a process has never been broken. It doesn't mean it will happen only at that time. If you continue to explore your history, everything that happened, or the development of modern technology, or just like now when we are communicating, in a psychic state, it is also a higher civilization helping you. It is happening now. Why is it at this moment? Then you continue to ask the next question.

**Question:**What was the past life relationship between me and my daughter? Or is there any information about this for me? 
**Higher Spirit:**What is your past life connection with your daughter? What is your daughter's name? 

**Question:**My daughter's name is XXX

**Higher Spirit:**XXX, you're called XX, right? The past life relationship your daughter is... Your daughter with you has a lifetime, it's like she was your little kitten, it's like she was one of your pets. But the connection between you two is extremely strong and intimate because the nourishment you have for each other, that kind of love from you to her and the dependence from her to you, that kind of love. Then you both still want to continue to experience this sense of connection, intimacy, and the feeling of depending on each other. So it's a continuation of an emotion.

**Person 5:** I want to ask that I have been in a mental hospital three or four times and I want to ask that I am really mentally ill

Just like what was said in the previous spiritual communication, I'm in a spiritual communication state, but I don't know how to turn it on or off.
**Higher Spirit:**If you want to give this definition to you all based on everything that happens externally, it's that you rely on the doctor. Now this symptom has shown up, and then I'll give a conclusion. If you want to understand from such things, from this perspective, you are, do you understand? Then if you think your person is not subject to any restrictions, no matter what you were like before, you can become the person you want to be in every present moment. Do you understand these two different choices? It's like I'm telling you now, one choice A, one choice B. No matter which choice you make, it's true and correct because there's never a right one or a wrong one here.
 Then you don't know. You need to figure it out.But that sense of integration, I remember it very clearly.
**Higher Spirit:**Through this energy, you can see some things that the eyes can't see. What did you see?

**Question:**I think I saw, that there were some other beings... I don't remember clearly. Mainly after this dream, in the morning, a being came to me and suddenly I couldn't move. I felt a powerful energy and then a voice told me how to enhance my energy. Then I told him with great difficulty that I couldn't hear clearly what you said. Could you say it again? Then he repeated his content to me again. But when he repeated it for the second time, other beings joined and I felt like the radio was changing channels. Then I want to know what information that being wanted to bring me. 

**Higher Spirit:**Wait a moment. I want to see if I'll have this energy communicate with you directly or see what kind of information they want to bring to you. Wait a moment. I need to connect. I'm the energy that has been trying to connect with you. And then, thank you for taking the initiative to connect with me, allowing me to bring this message to you. Because in one of your life themes, I'll work with you to convey information, as if we were messengers. It's just that you're still groping right now, just like a baby learning to walk and not being fully capable by yourself... So it's the very beginning stage now. Therefore, you'll constantly have such an experience and journey.
It's about constantly allowing our energies to blend more and then, well, do you want to know what information is meant to be brought to you? And currently, there's no any information because the information emerges based on you, like when the other party or yourself has questions, and then we'll have the information. This is a process where you ask questions and we answer. That is, there isn't. But this is like a process of energy blending, do you understand? So this is a process of energy blending instead of saying that when I come to you, there will be a bunch of information for you to do this and that. Because we are like in a cooperative, mutually cooperative role. If you don't take the initiative to invite, or link, or ask on your side, we won't keep telling you a lot. In this way, it will affect one aspect of your material world. It's like, how to say it, it's like if you have no willingness to do this thing and I urge you, it's like I'm manipulating you. Then our relationship is mutual. That is, you have this need, and then we will have this connection. It will be like this.
It's like if you don't have this need, then we won't actively make you talk nonsense like this. Such words are affecting your own experience in your material world.

**Question:**🗎, then can I ask what should I do to achieve a stable connection with you? Is there any information in this regard?
**Higher Spirit:**You don't need to do anything because everything will... It's like you are walking forward, and then all the roads are already in this direction It will be on the way. Every stage will show up automatically. So you don't need to do anything from your mind or make it happen quickly. Just like a seed during its growth process, you can't make it grow fast. Do you understand? It's a natural process.

**Question:**Then I want to ask you, did you tell me earlier that I should link to your being through writing first?
**Higher Spirit:** Link to your being through writing first. First, you need to know that this is an energy. It doesn't have any individuals. It's not like in your material world where there are three people, A, B, and C. This A comes to you, B, C. Do you understand what I mean? It's not a single individual. It's this energy. Also, sometimes when you are too eager to want something to happen, you are actually missing it. So you don't need to be in a hurry or do anything to force this thing to happen quickly, understand? You keep talking

**Question:**Because when you came to me last time, I heard you say that you told me what to do to increase my energy. Then I want to know if what I heard was what I meant.
**Higher Spirit:**How do you have to do to increase your energy? Then this is something you yourself are concerned about in your consciousness, that is, how you want to operate, how to make it... Do you understand what I mean? Because your consciousness will create some phenomena for you. For example, OK, we are now a stream of energy approaching you, right? If there is a lot of fearful energy within you, you will manifest this stream of energy as a devil to scare yourself. 
If this energy, if you believe in angels, then this energy will take on the form of an angel. So it, the energy is neutral. (Unclear) How to perceive this energy but what form it will take. It will depend on yourself. It will depend on you. You are like a filter, understand? You continue.

**Question:**I have another question about the little mouse I'm raising now and suddenly its leg is not good. I don't know if this question can be asked. I want to ask if it has any needs. How can I help it? Then does it have any hope for what I can do to make it more comfortable? It can have a happier life.
**Higher Spirit:** Wait a moment. First, we will talk here about a problem related to a sick pet.
Why? Because this psychic lady also saw that many of her friends around her were experiencing pet illnesses, that is, an experience and process of pets getting sick. So when it came to this topic exactly, and now you brought it up again, then we came out to talk about how there is this kind of... Firstly, that is to say when a pet encounters a disease, it's actually like, there is a saying that it helps you fend off disasters, right? Why does it help you fend off disasters? Because you have an inner belief, for example, that people are useless when they get old, people will get sick when they get old, oh, I'm weak, I have to buy insurance, I have to protect myself. When you have this kind of consciousness, you will let something similar happen around you. Do you understand what I mean? It might project onto your own children. That could be yourself. That could also be your pet. So, pets show you in the form of illness that I'm sick. In fact, it's to make you see that you have such a thing inside: Life is fragile. Isn't life like that? Do you understand what I mean? Because if you yourself fully enjoy life, if you don't pretend, I pretend to enjoy life, or I enjoy life when a good thing happens in my life. Because when you enjoy life, enjoying life doesn't need any excuse or any reason or anything else. It's not that I feel safe today, so I enjoy. Or I won today's lottery or had a happy event, so I enjoy. Rather, you feel all the time that life itself is a state of pleasure, abundance, and happy enjoyment, and it's safe.
If you are in such an energy state, you won't encounter, for example, the suffering of a pet or go through such a process. Because even if it has some minor illnesses or is externally infected with something, it will recover on its own during the process when you are enjoying, that is, when you emit a pleasant energy state. Do you understand? So they actually have diseases, but the diseases
It seems to disappear and disappear again. Why? Because you have been... It's like when you are boiling water and your kettle is very hot and the energy is very strong, the bacteria in the water die. That is to say, anything around you that doesn't match your body, because in such a high-energy, high-vibration, high-frequency state as yours, they have no way to attach. So only you. It's like you say that damp places breed bacteria, right? If you are always in a damp state, then that place of yours will definitely produce some bacteria and breed a lot of bacteria, right? Because you provide a good breeding ground for these bacteria, nourishing and breeding them. It's not that there are no bacteria in other places, but that bacteria can't survive in this place. Do you understand?

So in your lives, you don't need to have any worry or fear or concern or the thought of protecting yourselves. Because you only need to live in your total joy, and then even if you accidentally bump into something, get bruised, or get infected by bacteria, it will naturally go to, as I just said, a state where bacteria qol& cannot breed.

**Question:**Then can I ask what kind of belief of mine caused it to get sick? Can you tell me this?
**Higher Spirit:** Yes. You said its hind legs suddenly retracted and haven't been able to stretch out for many days?

**Question:**🗎 Its hind legs suddenly retracted and haven't been able to stretch out for many days.
**Higher Spirit:** It will reflect a situation that allows you to see that you feel your actions are restricted now, that you feel your actions are restricted now, do you understand? You feel that you need external help, do you understand? Just in your deepest part, you will feel like I seem to need someone to give me a hand, I need someone to support me. It seems that I can't fully express myself, like I can't dance, can't sing, can't soar. I need someone either to support me or to help me. Right now, I can't spread my wings and fly. Because in your deep, deep, deep, that is, the innermost part, there will be such a feeling there.

**Question:**Then can I ask again there... Because in my conscious mind... that innermost part... Let's just ask like this. In fact, in my dreams these two days, I can somewhat sense that kind of feeling of needing to worry and feeling trapped, which has presented itself to me in the dream. So how can I release it, or will I release it just by seeing it? Still, is there any method?
**Higher Spirit:**You are already here now. You already know that this phenomenon produced by your animal is an inner projection of yourself, understand? For example, if we replace the animal with your child, who is influenced by your energy and shows that appearance. If your energy changes, his state also changes. So it is projected to your closest ones. So you need to, for example, be responsible for your subordinates, or the state of your company, or something like that, everything around you. Because your energy state is influencing everyone. Understand? So if all of you on Earth know that, for example, if your friend or someone else gets sick, his disease Because disease is also suicide, and it's also an unhappy state. To take responsibility for his suicide or for any of his, for others' pain, you will emit different energy. Because you know that in the deepest part you may be desperate about life, or something like that. This energy will affect everything you see, that is, the disasters in the world that you can see or cannot see. The epidemic that you are experiencing now is a kind of desperation about life for you all, that is, restraint, that is, entanglement... I am a victim, that is, the kind of inability, that kind of powerlessness. All these are manifestations of your collective consciousness.

**Question:**Then about myself, I still have one last question. That is because I found that in fact, in terms of relationships, I have always been using material standards to measure whether I am worth it or not. So I saw that all these people who came into my life showed me this aspect to varying degrees. Then I wanted to know that apart from... **Higher Spirit:**You don't need to label yourself based on any emotional experiences. I was like this. I was like this. Do you understand what I mean? Because everything that happened in the past wasn't what you thought it was. Understand? It wasn't what you thought it was. Why wasn't it what you thought it was? It changes as your consciousness changes and what you get is like now your consciousness level is at 1, right? Then from a level of 1, you review everything that happened before. You can only find it within 1. Oh, this classification. Do you understand what I mean? When your cognition keeps expanding and your level rises to 5, the things you find will be different. That is, when you look back on your life. And if your level becomes 10 and you look back on your life, what you find will be different again. Do you understand what I mean? It's like you can extract something from your past experiences, people, or everything you have. It depends on your own state. So all these are not fixed, not definite, not absolute, not as you think. They are just your current state, cognition, and level of awareness. You can only get these from it. Do you want to give an account to your mind? Do you understand what I mean? So all these are illusions, these are mirages, and these are changing. It changes along with your own changes. So you don't have to bring up what you used to have because why? Your consciousness is constantly changing. During this process of us chatting, talking, and communicating right now, you have been continuously... For example, when you first came to me, your level was at 1, right? Then by the time we finish, you reach 100. Then you will look at what happened before from the perspective of 100. Oh, my God. Do you understand what I mean? So you don't need to bring up your past relationships, how you were, and then label yourself. Why? Because when you label yourself, your brain will think that way about yourself. You are limiting yourself. And when you limit yourself, you will again attract the same kind of people to you. Do you understand what I mean? You will create such an object, the same situation. 
你会仍然进入同一种限制。所以最重要的是不要做任何定义、评判或限制。所有这些都只是头脑创造的一些幻觉。你有问题吗？
问题：我实际上还有最后一个问题，但我不知道它值不值得问。
高灵：你说你不要任何……为什么你总是考虑值不值得问，行不行？为什么在你甚至还没采取行动之前这个想法就冒出来了？这个想法才是你需要面对的。你明白吗？因为它会阻碍你的行动。你们人类很多人都有这样的问题。在他们甚至还没说一句话，或者还没表达，还没（没听清）之前，“哦，别人肯定不会听的。”“这个怎么能这样？”
They denied themselves first, understand? Because when you speak, before you speak your brain can't think of what you are going to express next. For example, this psychic girl, before she speaks psychically, she doesn't know what information you are going to communicate next. If everything is planned and set by her mind, you are just dealing with the memories in your two minds. There are all dead things. What is it called? You have something called collusion. What is in this sewage? It's all like this. It's all in a state of creating something. For example, you are deepening some of the fears in society. Understand what I mean? For example, some events occur in society now. That event is so terrifying. Then you continue to communicate, 'Wow, it's really terrifying!' Let it continue to affect your life. You keep creating like this.

**Question:**Then the last question about myself is because my teeth have always been bad and I used to dream that someone abused me and there were torture. Then I want to ask about this aspect because I have experienced such an experience before. Is there anything that can be released or is there any information that is coming in?
**Higher Spirit:** The problem of your bad teeth first of all means that, number one, you should notice how you treat your teeth in your life, that is, how you treat them. Your teeth also need to be constantly cleaned, cleared, cared for and protected, right? It's like if you think this way. You have a flower planted in your garden and you think the flower doesn't grow well or something. Have you paid attention to it? Understand? If you don't take care of it at all, then it will definitely be overgrown with weeds or not grow well, right? So a garden that is taken care of and a garden that is not taken care of are different, right? So for a part of your body, you first have to realize whether you really have taken care of it. If you have taken care of it completely on the material level, right? Then on the spiritual level, you have to start considering some of your issues on the spiritual level, psychological level, beliefs, etc.
First, you have to eliminate the visible ones. After you eliminate the visible ones, then you look at it and eliminate the invisible influences. The invisible influence. For instance, what do teeth represent? Teeth represent strength. Then do you think your strength is limited? Your strength is affected. You can't truly exert your strength. Because each of you has different beliefs, different operation modes, and different living habits. That is, you are different in all aspects. So you still need to ask yourself from your own perspective. It's like you yourself are your own doctor. You examine yourself. You keep talking. There is another sentence. Just like the previous piece of information, when you are in a safe, joyful, and pleasant energy, that is, a frequency, your body will naturally recover. It won't generate bacteria and won't nourish those. 
**Question:**The next question is that we want to know what the mechanism of spiritual communication is. Then can any question be asked?
**Higher Spirit:**What is the mechanism of spiritual communication? Any question can be asked, but not all questions will unfold in the way you think you want because we don't know in what direction your questions will unfold. This is about, like in communication and spiritual communication, the meaningful part is that we don't know ourselves what information will come next. We don't mean that everything is already, as if it were your program, where you input this and this comes out. Because these, as I just said, are all alive. Then what is the mechanism of spiritual communication? Then let's talk about this communication that we are currently having right now, right? That is to say, when you completely let go of your mind and enter into that energy, because you should know that energy is everywhere. It's always there, everywhere. OK. For example, before, you have been walking with your legs, right? Then when you reach the river, you completely enter into the river and follow the direction of the river. Do you understand? Because you are in a completely relaxed and trusting state. You won't fall into the river. Do you understand what I mean? You are following this energy continuously. But as you said, where is the source of its information? The source of the information is just like everything in your material world, your lives, then animals, everything, everything, everything that you can see with your naked eyes, visible or invisible, all come from the same source. Understand? So the information is also from the same source. It just passes through you. For example, there are various kinds... There are flowers of various colors, but the source of the flowers, for example, is actually from nothingness. It's like in an energy state, it keeps going but it passes through and it has different kinds.
The psychic information for you is also. Keep going.

**Question:**How can one have an iron will?
**Higher Spirit:**How to have an iron will. This is what this psychic girl is currently concerned about. She wants to, because she herself is in an energy state with an iron will. She is such a person. So, it's like you yourself are a tiger, right? So, you have a special kind of, chasing, running, howling, or hunting. You have a kind of, in your bones. It's in your genes. That is to say, when it's a tiger all the time and it has this desire, then for example, if it's a fish all the time, it's a different state, right? So when she has the urge to possess, actually she already possesses. Do you understand? It's like you observe what characteristics other animals of yours have. Actually, deep down in her heart, she has known for a long time that she is in such a state. So when such an idea arises in her, she herself is a personality with an iron will.
Then how to possess it? You yourself are. You just have to recognize that just like you yourself are a tiger, so you will want to hunt, want to chase, want to run, and want to roar. Because it's your energy that wants to be released, right? It's like if you don't know yourself and you think you are a mouse and you look at other mice, but you want to have the bravery and fierceness of a tiger. But you just need to recognize that you are a tiger. When you recognize that you are a tiger, that roaring, or hunting, or fierce display is inherently yourself, and of course you can show it. Do you understand what I mean? So when you recognize your true identity, you can use it. It's not that you can possess. Possessing is when you don't have it and then go and get it. You can show it.  
Then for your entire life, for instance, if your life is worth ten points, right? You've only gone through three-tenths of it and you're already judging yourself based on these three-tenths. Do you think this is fair? Is this correct? Is this meaningful? Is this useful?

**Question:**I understand. Then the next question is that this girl has been constantly dreaming of being abused by others recently and she wants to ask why this is happening. Is there any information to convey to her?
**Higher Spirit:**She always dreams of something comparative, as if she becomes a victim, being abused and oppressed. Do you know what this is? This is her compassionate heart, that kind of sympathy she has for people all over the world. She wants to... Because she is currently in a state of enjoying life. She enjoys life and everything.
Everything about her is very, very wonderful. However, she voluntarily took on the pain of those oppressed people. Do you understand? So she would experience these in her dreams. Why? Because when she experiences these in her dreams, she profoundly realizes how many people are going through... The dream she had a few days ago was like, it was as if why do we have to use such a way to harm each other, that is, why is it so tragic between people, this thing of mutual harm happening. After she had this experience, because the experience in your dreams is the same as the experience in your material world. After having this experience, she will not treat others in this way because she herself has experienced that kind of pain. Do you understand? So on the level of her soul, she voluntarily undertook all the current situations of anyone being oppressed, or feeling powerless, or being victimized, or being abused because she had dreams of being abused in various ways. When she had, you know, the heart of compassion, the heart of compassion for the world, after she had this heart of compassion, when she treated people again, she would not use any such persecutory means. She would use the means of peace and love to bring about everything because this is related to one of her soul themes, which is related to what she wants to show in this world. So she chose to continue experiencing the suffering of all beings in her dreams to remind her of her mission in this world because sometimes we forget, for example, when we are too immersed in the joy and happiness of the material world. Because currently all she experiences in the physical world are beauty, love, joy and happiness. Then when you are constantly immersed in such a state, you will forget that you live in a tragic world, right? You will forget that others are still suffering. You will forget it and experience the completely opposite side of her life through dreams. This makes her remember how many people there are. It's a way for her to remind herself, so that she doesn't forget her mission and then have that kind of fighting power. So this is a process of her own growth, a process of becoming her, as if she set these lessons and experiences for herself.

**Question:**Suddenly I thought of a question and I want to ask **Higher Spirit:** You said, 
**Question:**I was looking at that transmission about Abraham Hicks She mentioned a focus wheel, like a focusing Ferris wheel. Usually, we have many thoughts in our minds. If I just focus my mind's thoughts on a thought or an idea that makes me feel good, that's such a focus. It can accelerate the manifestation in the physical world. Or is there any information about this that can be brought in? I don't know how to ask particularly well.
**Higher Spirit:**You mean using your mind to focus, that is, to manifest your world. But no. Look at how many people are lost in focusing on money, right? Did they become rich? They calculate everywhere all the time, 'Ah, how much money can I earn here?' "Ah, I suffered a loss here." Have they become rich? No. It's not that your mind focuses on something and it will happen. Instead, it's about having the ability to transform it. For example, if this thing occurs in the material world and it's supposed to make you worse, but you have the ability to turn it into something beneficial or good for you. Or you can extract the good aspect. It's like you're a scientist or an inventor. You can extract the useful part. Do you understand what I mean? And prevent those useless parts from affecting your life. If you don't have a high enough level of cognition, you can't do it.
That is to say, this is related to your cognition... Because everything that happens externally is neither absolutely good nor bad. None of them are absolutely good or bad. How to have sufficient high energy, or cognition, wisdom, that is, power to utilize it. For instance, you see that the British royal family has power and influence. However, it doesn't mean that those people can utilize it well and live well among them. Do you understand? So, having what kind of situation, standing at what height, or what kind of appearance or what to focus on is not important. What is important is that how you can utilize this energy. Just like that, this energy is close to you, and it is... The energy is by your side, not... You will then do something. It is always there and you can always utilize the energy. How exactly do you utilize this energy? Or how do you let it serve and affect you? This is a... for you personally. You are like a filter. Then it depends on your own cognition, your state, your belief, and everything of yours. 
Can you handle it well? Understand? You handle it well, you operate it well. Everything is here to serve you. It's not that I just sit here, pay attention to money every day, think about money, and then I can become rich. It's not like that.

**Question:**I understand. Then can I ask what my biggest restrictive belief is now? Or have you already told me just now?
**Higher Spirit:** Your restrictions. During our chat, you keep discovering that you have many restrictions. So when you listen to the recording again, you will find that every angle of yours, every point we talked about, there is a restriction of your own set of concepts on you.
Everyone, where are you? If you use just a little bit in your mind to analyze things, you can discover... You should know that there's never a state of "this is the end" here. Understand? Every step of yours, every step is constantly making yourself in a more and more relaxed state. There is no such point, OK. I'm fine. I'm done. No. It's always constantly... Even when we are communicating information, our information is constantly changing.

**Question:**The last question is that we want to link with Michael Jackson and see if he has any message he wants to bring to humanity.
**Higher Spirit:** Michael Jackson, wait a moment. I am now in the personality of Michael Jackson to talk to you all. Then you guys want to know what information I have to bring to you. First of all, the information I want to bring to you is that I feel very, very relieved that some of you are willing to listen to me, to share, and to let me speak. I feel very much like, as if I'm grateful to you, thank you. And from this perspective now, I will find that in my own life, I am a very pessimistic person. I have many common points and many differences with this lady. Many common points mean that we both have the same compassion for the whole world. There are so many people suffering in the world, understand? But I'm showing it in a pessimistic way, understand? I'm showing it in a pessimistic way.
This is when I look back on my life and I'm not particularly satisfied with some of my own behaviors and practices.  and So she did the exact opposite thing to me. She wants to show others that in the future, she is going to show a world that all of you humans yearn for. She shows it to people and then people join in. But it's like we are all working together. So I am also very relieved that there is such an energy state of hers, which can make up for some of the things that I created and showed when I came to this world. It can give me a feeling of compensation or relief, a feeling of peace. Then what I want to bring to this world is that everything has a process of growing and becoming. And don't get stuck in this process. For example, some people need to see through war to understand how important peace is. But don't get stuck in the war. Do you understand what I mean? Because it's for the arrival of peace. Because everything, it's not an immediate process. It's a gradual process. This gradual process, you might fall into pits many times. You might experience a lot of darkness. But don't get trapped by the darkness on the way. Because I was trapped by the darkness on the way at that time. Do you understand? So just know that darkness is a process you go through, but it's not the end. Because the end for all of us is light and love. The end for all of us is love. And I haven't disappeared because I know there are many people's enthusiasm for me. 
但是我并没有消失我可以在任何时候,你们想要跟我链接的时候跟我链接还有什么问题吗
问: 没有问题了,谢谢


## 2021/12/06 - Online group Psychic Q&A

The first person 
**Question:**I want to ask about my life theme .
**Higher Spirit:** Do you want to know the theme of your life that you need to experience this time in this material world? Question: Yes **Higher Spirit:** What is your name? Question: XX **Higher Spirit:** You call XX you wait for XX information, he wants to know his life experience of the theme of your own choice is to become unconditional love, understand that you will love, a love is a big love, unconditional love, and then become a theme center of your experience
For instance, in life you might encounter some people who don't understand you or even hurt you. From a material perspective, you need to be forgiving, understanding and tolerant. That is to say, you want to reach a state of just love, not caring about what you experience, how others treat you, or anything external. Just a state of love.
So you might go through a lot on the surface. For example, betrayal, hurt or something like that in the human world. And it's for you to make yourself reach a state where no matter how others treat you, because you want to let go of the word "I", understand? Because when you let go of the word "I", who can hurt you? 
Only when you project a me with your consciousness and everything you have, and see it on your appearance, will you feel hurt. If you remove that, that is, remove that me, you are everything. In this way, you won't feel anything... So this is a state that you yourself want to reach. Then you will set up many similar experiences for yourself from all aspects.

**Question:**Then I still want to ask questions.
**Higher Spirit:** You say. 
**Question:**I would like to ask if my Higher Self and guiding spirits have anything they want to say to me?
**Higher Spirit:** What your Higher Self and guiding spirits want to say to you. Wait a moment. No matter how dark a place you are in, you just need to remember that it's such an experience you chose yourself to make you remember that you are the light.
This is the message for you. Do you understand? You don't need to search for the light or have others illuminate you or whatever, because you are the light yourself. Because only in the darkness can you see that you are the light. If you are in the light... Do you understand what I mean? So no matter what you experience externally, it's just to make you recall, to make you know who you are. So you need the opposite. You need an opposite aspect. Just like there is a saying called a sharp contrast, right? So you need that sharp contrast to let you know. So that so-called darkness is just an illusion. It's just to make you recognize or remember who you are. To let you know who you are.
Then this is the message for you.

**Question:**I still want to ask if I can confirm whether I am a wanderer. If so, what density is it?

**Higher Spirit:**What is a wanderer?

**Question:**A wanderer is someone who returns from a higher density to the third density to learn or to help others.
**Higher Spirit:**The information you just mentioned has already been said before. It has been made very clear to you that you need to find out who you are by yourself through yourself.

**Question:**OK. Then I'll ask another question. Can I confirm whether a person is my twin flame?
**Higher Spirit:**What is a twin flame?

**Question:**My understanding of twin flame is that it belongs to the same high spirit, the same oversoul.
**Higher Spirit:**The same oversoul. Your so-called twin flame, do you want to know that you and he/she have chosen the same, like a path or a goal, together with you. 
**Question:**Yes, it's such a person. Have I met this person now?
**Higher Spirit:**You want to know that in the material world with you. You need to know this of yours. It's just like this journey of life. It's just like this section of the road. Then this section of the road, it's not that a person is the same from birth to old age, understand? Different stages. Then how to describe this? For example, when you were still a seed in the soil, what did you need? Then maybe what accompanied you, beside you, in such a dark and damp place, what accompanied you was an earthworm, right? Understand? Then the earthworm was your friend because it was in the soil. But when you grew up and sprouted out, on that level of the soil surface later There might be caterpillars in that vegetable field, right? When you grow to a certain extent, bees, butterflies, birds... When you have branches... Birds... Do you understand what I mean? When this tree of yours grows larger and larger, there are countless bird nests that can come up.
But this is related to you. When you were a seed, the earthworm didn't leave either. Do you understand? For example, when you become a big tree and you want to connect with the birds, you can connect with them. The butterflies can still approach you. Your roots can still connect with the earthworm. Can you understand this relationship? If you are talking about the emotional aspect, for example, your love is another matter.

**Question:**Can it be like before, with the metaphor of butterflies, bees, and earthworms? Or rather... 
**Higher Spirit:** First of all, you yourself from the beginning to the end. From the beginning to the end means that no matter what... This is impossible. Do you understand what I mean? That is to say, you may seemingly, on the material level, choose a marital partner. That's on your material level. But on the soul level, you can't have a connection with only one object because you are connected with everything. This connection, you can't terminate it. This is impossible to happen. You continue to ask.

**Question:**Does the future me have anything to say to the present me?
**Higher Spirit:** Wait a moment. What information does the future you want to tell you? He has information to tell you. It's like you have one, how... It's a kind of human body function or something that doesn't seem very common in your material world. It's like you have a door that needs to be opened, and then that door requires you. Next, you need to notice that your body has a function, or there is one... For example, the psychic ability of this girl, right? She keeps using it in this field.
Then her ability becomes stronger and stronger as she gets older. And you yourself also have a function that you carry with you. You need to connect with it. You need to pay attention and notice.

**Question:**Then I would like to ask if I have used this function before or if I haven't even touched this function at all now.
**Higher Spirit:**Have you used it before? You have unconsciously come into contact with it and it has surprised you, like an energy. That energy has been trying to... For example, you watch a lot of movies, right? Then there are some that are fire, some are water, some are like this... It's like this energy. For example, let's say you and water, for instance, because that information hasn't arrived yet. For example, you and water, you can utilize the energy of water, for example. Let's say, for instance, I give an example. You can utilize the energy of water. You can infuse your own energy into the water and then give it to others. Then others can receive it. It's like this. You can purify water. This is also an item... Some people have a connection with fire. Some people are with water, some people are with earth. But because I haven't received your information yet about exactly what it is with, but I know there is a door that needs you to open it yourself. 
问: OK. Can this information be known today?
**Higher Spirit:**Whether it can be known today. Wait a moment. I'll help you search. Then you need to ask.
问: Then I just want to know the specifics of this ability. Can you describe it again and give me some hints?
**Higher Spirit:**You want to know what kind of ability you have exactly. I can't tell you today because next... It's like, for example, if I tell you directly now, your life will lose that amazing experience, that amazing experience. It's like I took your gift away. Do you understand? Because each of you has what you need to experience when you come to this material world at every moment. It's like magical. It's that kind. If I tell you that you are this, then you will skip that part to discover... That is, you actually have... Do you understand what I mean?
... that kind of surprise, and then your life experience seems to be taken away. It's unfair to you, so you'll discover it yourself. And you just need to know that at every stage of your life, there will be surprises. It's as if you're constantly unwrapping gifts. You increasingly discover that you are so unlimited.

**Question:**OK, I understand. My questions are over. The second person asks: I want to ask if my spirit guide and higher self have any messages for me regarding my current state and what I've been doing recently.
**Higher Spirit:** Wait a moment. Do you want to know if there's any information from the spiritual realm for you? Let go of all worries, concerns, fears, and also let go of all the desire to be quick. Do you understand what I mean? Because just like the previous piece of information, if you directly reach a certain point, you will miss many surprises and gifts and such at the moment... Then think about it, if you are at the first step now, and I directly tell you what your tenth step is, then you have 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and there are 9 gifts that haven't been opened. Do you understand? When your 9 gifts haven't been opened, you have 9 fewer gift boxes to share with others because if you haven't opened that gift box, what joy, excitement and surprise do you have for others to feel the same, that is, the surprise of life, right? So many people in your material world seem to want to reach the sky in one step. Reaching the sky in one step will make it seem like you have missed your life. It's like, for instance, you were just born as a baby. Why I... Then immediately you reach a hundred years old and your life ends because there is no result here. Then every step, every step is a feast. So if you take away the feast, what are you pursuing? Understand?


**Question:**Understand. I haven't been using some ways and methods of the material world recently, like for example, the deliberate creator. The things I do, and then the message you bring to me, does it mean that what I'm doing is against my... 
**Higher Spirit:**Just like for example, you need to go through struggle at present, right? But you don't want to go through this struggle and you just want to reach a completely relaxed state directly. Understand? Then you lose a gift. 
Then you haven't found that kind of transition from feeling so stressed and struggling to being completely released... You lack that process of how to unwind. You don't understand how to unwind, do you understand? In this way, you can't become a teacher and you can't have life experience. Then what are you doing in this material world?
You have nothing to share. You see those of yours, that is, all those lecturers or mentors or particularly influential speakers. They have a lot to share, right? Then if there are a hundred thousand people listening to your speech below, what are you going to share? Do you understand? People have no interest in this kind of person who has no worries about food and clothing and has never encountered any difficulties. Do you understand what I mean? Think about it when you listen to those super powerful stories. Isn't it that the more limitations a person has, for example, he is black, he has nothing, he has diseases, he is disabled, he is... That is, he is all limitations.

But he has reached an unrestricted state, that is, the highest point in the world. Such a story and a person who has experienced nothing since birth. If the two tell stories, whose would you listen to?

**Question:**I understand what you said and I also know that this kind of contrast can help me know how to help others in the future. But what I don't understand is, for example, I sit down now to write something. These things make me feel very good because what we need to do is to keep ourselves in a state where we feel good. This is a way to make myself focus through writing. So do you mean that I shouldn't do it now? Are these wrong?
**Higher Spirit:** Why is your mind full of good, right, shouldn't, wrong, and you still want someone more authoritative to tell you which is right and which is wrong? This is what you yourself need to ask yourself. Because right and wrong, should or shouldn't, which is good or not good are in your minds. You are still stuffing yourself with those concepts and definitions in your mind. Only through experience, and each experience has meaning, has value, is invaluable, and is a feast. Only when you reach such a state can you create. Otherwise, you have no inspiration. You just say that I heard that mentor say this way is good, then I meditate. Understand? That teacher says dancing is good, and I go dancing. You don't need to follow anyone because each of your paths is different. The most serious problem is that each of you sees who is successful and then follows them without knowing why. Then you do it even if you don't like it. Why? Because the teacher said it's right. Because everyone says he's right. But you are still a prisoner, imprisoned by the concepts in your mind. No matter how good, wonderful and successful what the tutor or the teacher said is, it belongs only to him. You must remember one sentence: this belongs only to him. Because a true tutor won't tell you that you have to follow my method or else you won't make it. This is not the case. This is again a trap and a shackle, a chain to bind you. Don't use any standard to measure whether what you do is right or not, whether doing this or that is right or not.  and 
**Question:**What I don't understand is, well, how to put it. Maybe it's just my own mind thinking. That is to say, have I recently entered my mind again? Is that what it means?
**Higher Spirit:** You don't need to judge whether you yourself are doing well or not, right or not. You don't need to ask me whether you are doing well or not. I just want you to see clearly what kind of system your mind is operating now, to make you see clearly and understand? If you can't see clearly, you are operating unconsciously. Then what you can create are only those things you think in your mind. What we want to do is not to let you rely on us, or attach to us, or consider us authoritative. But to say that you yourself are the creator. You yourself have unlimited energy, unlimited everything possible. The most important thing is what exactly you want. You don't even know what you want, what you want to become, what you want to experience, what you want to create. Even if I give you everything, like those things you need, equipment or subjects, giving you all the things, what can you create? Because you don't have a clear idea of what you want to create at all. In your material world, those successful people, they clearly know what they want to become and what they want to create. They clearly know where they want to go. This is the most important thing.
The third person **Question:** I want to know what information my Higher Self wants to bring to me.
Higher Self: What information does your Higher Self want to bring to you? What's your name? 

**Question:** My name is XXX. 

**Higher Spirit:**The information of XXX.  and  and 
But now you know that others drown because they know nothing about the sea water.
Now I'm going to explore inside the sea because it's my own choice. Then next I have decided that I'm going to explore the seabed, right? So I'm going to learn. I'm going to learn diving from experienced people and then I can explore freely inside and expand my experience. Do you understand what I mean?


**Question:**Yes, I understand. But I think I'm quite confused in my life. To be honest, I do have many, many things I want now, but I'm still very confused. It's like I don't know what to do next. Every day is just that kind of muddled work and life and such.
So, I don't know exactly what that challenge is. 
**Higher Spirit:**The challenge will emerge... All of you, that is to say, for example, from your family relations, marital relations, relations at work, any of the relations or different situations, different scenes, different people that you seem to have on the surface. OK, but you will find that all it presents is actually the same problem. You are confused at work, right? But if, that is to say, this feeling of confusion... It actually occurs in every (aspect). It doesn't just occur at work. It's like if your level is three in a game, then the probability you experience in every venue is three. So you don't need to figure out exactly where the restraint is or how it is. Because in every moment, in every life, for example, you observe yourself. For instance, why do I dislike my boss? Why do I dislike my family members? Why do I dislike my husband? Why can't I stand others like this? For instance, why can't I stand my husband? Why can't I stand my boss? For example, let's say, all these will show up, present themselves to you from different aspects, and you can see yourself.

**Question:**🗎, Is it to experience and see those things from your own relationships?
**Higher Spirit:** Everything in front of you, think this way. Everything your eyes see is like a monitor, right? Then it's like a monitor. And that monitor is showing you all the time, even when you are just sitting there watching TV. When you see a plot in a TV drama and you have a feeling of disgust, or fear, or excitement because if you are excited, you must be... Do you understand what I mean? If you observe yourself, behind all emotions there must be something you need to break through.

**Question:**I kind of understand a little. I still want to ask the second question. My grandpa has been gone for a long time. I want to know, I want to connect with him because I miss him very much. Can I connect with him? Then, does he want to say anything to me?
**Higher Spirit:**Let me see if your grandpa has any message for you. Your grandpa seems to speak dialect. Then I will only convey the meaning he brings to you. He wants to tell you that he has never disappeared from your life. And he has been paying attention to all your dynamics and everything about you. Then he said that his distance from you was just like before. He always stood behind you, then looked at you kindly, watched your every move with a smile. Then he said that he is still in such a state now, looking at you, watching your every move. Then he said that at present, at this place and this stage, he said you don't need to worry, you don't need to be afraid, and you don't need to be concerned. Then the only thing you need is to do what you like to do and not wrong yourself.

**Question:**Thank you, Grandpa. Well, sometimes I get very flustered in my heart and my temper becomes very bad. I don't know what the reason is.
**Higher Spirit:** Sometimes you get very flustered. To what extent especially? How many times a day

**Question:**Anyway, there is at least one such feeling every day. It is only like this when encountering some things. When encountering some sudden events, it is generally relatively calm, but that feeling of flusteredness... 
**Higher Spirit:**First of all, you need to know that you are now a material body. That body itself is conscious, and then the consciousness of this body itself has received a lot... For example, it's so simple. There is a little pig, right? You put it
among a hundred pigs. As soon as it enters, the other 99 little pigs suddenly panic and run in one direction. That little pig will also unconsciously follow and run over there. Do you understand? It doesn't know why itself... So your body is like your own body. It still has a consciousness Its consciousness can be influenced by your collective consciousness. Your collective consciousness and an energy field around you. For example, why do people like to travel? If it's a very beautiful scenery, but you are in a state where you are crowded and can't move freely, you won't enjoy the scenery. But if there aren't so many people and you can fully immerse yourself in a very beautiful and charming scenery, these two states are different, right? So one thing is that your body itself will be affected by the outside world.
So what you can do is that if you can create for your body... It's like a pet you raise. Again, create a good condition for it. For instance, create a good condition for yourself. For example, don't go to places where the energy is particularly mixed. Right? You avoid some particularly mixed places because no matter what, you will be affected. So create a good environment for yourself. For example, some people have a lot of fear inside, and some people have a lot of anger inside. That is to say, when your own energy is unstable, you have less contact and create fewer conditions for such contact and environment. Because when you feel a stable energy state yourself, you can transform the energy around you. But if you are still in an affected state, then you can create a relatively pure energy field for yourself. You said: I am quite easily influenced by others.
I also want to ask that I have had rhinitis for many years. I feel that I have taken a lot of medicine and had surgery, but I don't know if there are any other reasons for this.
**Higher Spirit:** Wait a moment. I'll help you connect. You have rhinitis. What's the problem with your nose? 
**Question:** Sometimes it's very easy to be allergic, sneeze easily, have a runny nose and so on.
**Higher Spirit:** You want to know how this illness of your body is caused. Rhinitis. First of all, there are many, many people with allergic symptoms on your earth. Firstly, it has a great influence on your entire earth's environmental changes, that is, your living environment. For example, there are more and more chemical components now. It's like that kind of pure natural... Then it's as if it's a kind of karma created by you Earthlings that requires each of you Earthlings to bear and share. Understand? For example, if you plant a fruit tree yourselves, then you share the sweetness brought by the fruit. But if you plant a bad fruit yourselves, then each of you has to bear it. So, the entire environment has been somewhat polluted because you have created many artificial products, added many chemical components, which then leads to many, many allergic phenomena.
And this phenomenon is intensifying. So you will find that many newborns have many, many allergies, and those allergic phenomena are getting more and more serious. So you all need to collectively realize that you are creating an environment that is increasingly unsuitable for your own habitation. It's like you are given only one house and you live in it, right? If you make it a mess inside, with all kinds of things, constantly producing various chemical components, all kinds of pungent smells... Just think about your survival in that room. You will definitely smell those irritating odors, and it will surely affect your body. This is inevitable because here it means that you reap what you sow. That is, when you make a reaction or do something, there will definitely be a corresponding result for that thing.

**Question:**Are there any other reasons besides the environment?

**Higher Spirit:** Besides the environment, are there any other reasons? The first one I mentioned is the entire living environment of your Earth. Then the second one is that you yourself are a super sensitive person and you will be easily influenced by the outside world, so you only have rhinitis.
You will also have emotional aspects. For example, it may be particularly easy for some external energy states to affect an internal energy state of yours. It's not just an emotional aspect for you.

**Question:**Emotions are particularly susceptible to influence.
**Higher Spirit:** Yes, this is you... 
**Question:**How can we change this feeling? That is, don't be too easily influenced by others' emotions.
**Higher Spirit:** No matter what characteristics you bring with you, it is definitely not all disadvantages and no advantages. Do you understand? Because if you just want to take it away, you won't be able to get its benefits, the benefits for you. For example, you have a pair of hands attached to your body. But you don't know how to use them yet. You haven't learned how to use these hands. And mainly you feel they are a burden on your body. How could I cut off or remove this hand? If someone asks you such a question, you would think it's so stupid. Hands are here to help you. And your high sensitivity of the body is actually serving you too. So you just need to use it better and connect with it. For instance, you can do many things that others can't do. Because maybe others, when they see you communicating with someone, they only listen to what a person says. But you don't need others to say much. You can sense the other person's true emotions. Think about how much more you have than others... 
**Question:**It's really quite sensitive in this aspect, but it's also very easy to generate strong emotions or a bad temper for yourself.
**Higher Spirit:**You just need to recognize it and then apply it, understand? Because on Earth, like yours, compassion is very important. If others feel your compassion for them from you, the kind of empathy, a connection will be established immediately between you and them because you are the only one who can understand them. So apply it positively.

**Question:**OK. These are almost all my questions. Thank you.
The fourth person asks: Hello. I have a question now about individual unconsciousness. For example, I saw a sentence this morning that said "I deserve to have a happy life". But I am unconsciously convinced that I don't deserve a happy life. So if my subconscious believes that I deserve a happy life, but I unconsciously think I don't, then how can I change my individual unconsciousness?
**Higher Spirit:**You want to change your unconsciousness.

**Question:**Yes, it's the material mind.
**Higher Spirit:**One thing you mentioned here is that I'm just deceiving myself by saying with my mouth that I deserve it, but you don't really think so, right? Do you know that for everything, the most important thing is your inner state, understand? Because a person who truly understands that I deserve a happy life wouldn't say this. That is, they wouldn't be redundant like what you said. Understand? Only those who think that I haven't reached the kind of life that I think I deserve, they need to constantly hint to themselves, constantly, as if I'm going against you. You think you don't deserve it, I deserve it. They need to emphasize because in a real state, you don't need to emphasize.


**Question:**Then if I encounter something, in my heart, that mind will have an arrogant feeling towards certain people. How can I change it? Because sometimes when I encounter some people, my mind is always rather arrogant, but I think this is unnecessary. How can I change this feeling of the mind?
**Higher Spirit:**You don't need to change anything. The only thing you need is to know who you are. It's like I just said a piece of information earlier. That is to say, all your emotions let you know who you are. For example, you grew up in a pile of mice since childhood, and you haven't seen a mirror. But actually, you are a tiger, but you were raised by mice. You watched them all being sneaky and timid, and then you were like that too. But in your heart, you feel that you have powerful energy and you want to roar and shout because of the tiger's roar. But it's chirping. Do you understand? So only when you know your true identity, that you are a tiger, in your running, tearing, your energy, your roar, everything about you, such energy already exists. That is, you already have it. You just need to try and allow it to be released. Understand? So when you know who you are, all of your... You don't need to... People are not allowed to be arrogant, people are not allowed to be proud, people are not allowed to be conceited... Because they all say so. Because I think being conceited is bad. Then you keep looking for which word from the outside and then shape yourself into what kind of person according to that word. Understand what I mean? It's not like this. Instead, when you know who you are, you will naturally... You will present a you, and that you is unique. Because you know you won't do anything that harms others or is negative. Because you don't need to use negative events to grow. Understand what I mean? So this is a process of finding out who you are. Rather than learning how to be and acquire excellent qualities because all these already exist within you. It's just that you haven't... You're still on that path. You're still doing, exploring, and seeking yourself. You're still on the path of finding out who you are. Then allow that whether it's your emotions, your feelings, your beliefs, or whatever, all these are only temporary. None of these are the real you. It's like you have two identities. One is your physical body that experiences the material world, and the other is you observing yourself. Because through these, you will gradually know whether you are a tiger, a horse, or a snake. Because in your... It's as if every seed is already that seed before it sprouts. 
**Question:**Okay, I want to ask a question. I want to know how to calm my inner self and hear the voice within? Because personally, I have this kind of hyperactivity. Like a bit of hyperactivity. It's very difficult to calm my inner self down.
**Higher Spirit:**Wait a moment. Your hyperactivity. The reason for your hyperactivity is that you are not confident enough. You are not confident enough, that is, you want to... That is, you have an energy. You want to create many, many, many things and let others see your achievements. That is, you have a kind of desire to create through an external moving. That is, I constantly... You see, I build this castle very, very high. Keep doing this action. And when I build the castle very high and others' castles are not yet, others' (castles) are very short. I have a kind of: emmm... That is, you will have a kind of feeling that you are very powerful. So deep down in your heart, you still have a kind of desire to... It's this energy that wants to be constantly released to create something that makes you seem powerful. But the reason why you have this urge is that you think you are not powerful enough and not confident enough.
So the fundamental reason is that if you can go through continuous self-growth and self-awareness, and then you reach such a state of being your true self, then your state in terms of your material, that is, the state that seems to be moving on the surface, will change. Do you have any more questions?

**Question:**No.
The fifth person **Question:** I want to know what is the purpose of souls constantly being reborn on Earth?

**Higher Spirit:**It's for you to learn! Because the Earth is like a school, and in this school, you can learn anything you want to experience or study.

**Question:**Then where do they come from, these souls? 
**Higher Spirit:** Most of them are native souls of the Earth. Do you understand what I mean? 
**Question:**Then can I ask what kind of soul I am?
**Higher Spirit:** Let me put it this way. The Earth is like an elementary school, a very primary planet because it still needs to keep learning from destruction. Because when you reach a certain level, that is, when your consciousness reaches a certain state, you don't need to learn from destruction. Destruction is a very extreme way of learning, so it is suitable for those who need very extreme... For example, some children need to be spanked. But it is particularly suitable for some of these beginner souls. So you will see many souls on Earth who are particularly infatuated with some, that is, on the surface, for example, on the physical level, such as lust, for example, good-looking or sexy, and then they are completely indulged in it because they only need to satisfy their sensory stimulation, on the surface. It's as if what you all said is animality, understand? For instance, just satisfying the need to eat, and then being satisfied with physical appearance. Because at higher levels, actually, for them, surface-level satisfaction is not sufficient. They are more about a kind of soul tempering or something at the spiritual level... Because they need something that is not at the superficial level... Those can't satisfy them

**Question:**The second question is that I want to ask when this epidemic will end.
**Higher Spirit:** When the epidemic will end depends on each of you. Because in some people's minds, the epidemic seems as if it never happened. In some people's minds, the epidemic is a good thing. In some people's minds, the epidemic is terrifying. So although it is the same thing, actually... It's as if each of you has a unique filter. Then it was filtered for you to experience by yourselves. So each of your experiences is unique. Then... 
**Question:**But don't know when it will end, right?
**Higher Spirit:**Because there is no concept of time here. Then what kind of state can be created? What kind of environment this society creates for you to experience is the consciousness of you humans, the thoughts in each of your minds, your states, and your energy to create what kind of experience for you. So it is not external. It is not that something external is thrown to you this or that. You are the creators. Then there is one more thing to remember that everything in front of you at present is an illusion. Then your inner fears, your inner resistance, or all that is within you, that kind of thing that resists, will deepen it. OK. For example, suddenly there appears an aspect. This aspect is just to let you know that currently there are many fears and a sense of powerlessness among humans, right? The kind of thought that humans are all victims. OK. You see this aspect, but it affects you and you are scared. Because if you are scared and you are affected, it's so terrifying. Then you make it solid. If more and more people are scared, and more and more people are like this above, in a state of panic and chaos, then that aspect becomes harder and harder. It's as if at the beginning that aspect was like a paper tiger. It was a layer of paper, very thin, very thin. So it was like mud or clouds. Although it looks very thick, in fact, it is a layer of smoke, nothing at all. However, your collective recognition of it. You will constantly deepen it, constantly making it harder and harder, such a state. So if you want to quickly get rid of the impact that the epidemic has brought to you, that is to say, you have no epidemic, no impact, no any... Why? Because your virus has always existed. It's just that the reaction it causes when entering each of your bodies is different.
Then why this time for your epidemic, for example, there are already many people with underlying diseases. You think that those with many underlying diseases already have many internal conflicts themselves, that is, negative energy, and many toxins. He himself was in such a state and then it seemed to reach a threshold. Bang! The epidemic was like a fuse that blew up an inner bomb within him. It will accelerate that your current material world has reached a point where all that happens is that those who have a desire to die in their hearts will die very quickly. Those who have a desire for success and ambition, that is, those who want to achieve their dreams, will very quickly seem to change overnight and become a different person the next day. So all manifestations in the material world are getting faster and faster. Then you need to clear even more, that is, what you want to manifest inwardly. You will unconsciously hold onto the fears of others and project that fear into your own world to experience. What you need to pay more attention to is this point. Where does my fear come from? This is not my fear. It might be a fear of survival from my parents. I'm holding onto it. So you must clearly see where the unconscious behaviors in your own mind come from. Let go of those that don't belong to you.


**Question:**OK. It's my father-in-law, my husband's father. He passed away about a year after our marriage. I always feel that I didn't show enough filial piety to him. So I want to know if he has anything to say to me and my husband. His name is XXX.

**Higher Spirit:**Wait a moment, XXX. Is there any information? 'It's too sudden, too sudden. I left too suddenly this time. I have a lot to say to you. I'm a little excited. I don't know. That is to say, you suddenly linked to me. I still haven't woken up and understood what happened. Why do I need to link with you in such a state? I'm very, very uncomfortable now. I still have some things that I want you to do for me. I still have a lot of things that haven't been dealt with. And this separation feels like you were suddenly taken out of my world, as if we suddenly became two worlds. Now I feel a healing energy that is making me a little calmer and more peaceful. First of all, thank you. Thank these spiritual friends around me. It's like surrounding me. And it was just like I had a heart attack just now.
Just now, I still wanted to tell you that I haven't let go of many things and there are many things that I want you to do for me. 
But now I mean, it's like from just a moment ago to another state. It's because my reluctance to the material world just now has turned into a kind of state where I start to accept existing in such a way. So I myself don't have any thing that requires you to do for me. Then I have some information that I want to tell you next. That is, no matter what, no matter what, you will always be my family. Any questions?

**Question:**No problem. Thank you.

December 8, 2021 - The Revelation Brought by the Energy of the Wind
**Higher Spirit:**You speak. What's the problem?

**Question:**We want to ask the energy of the wind to convey some confidence to us because the place where this girl lives at home today has a strong wind blowing, and then she wants to receive the energy of the wind to see if there is any information that can be brought to us.

**Higher Spirit:**Wait for the energy of the wind for a moment. If you want to connect to the energy of the wind, first of all, whether it's the energy of the wind, the energy of trees, the energy of other stones, or any other energy, all of them seem to come from the same source. It's just like you are fetching water from different wells, but the water source is the same. So if you have any questions, you can continue to (ask). Then, within your classification, if you think it's OK and I'm communicating with the energy of the wind this time, you can continue to ask. The more and more detailed questions you ask, the more information you will draw out.

**Question:**Then, can I ask how the wind operates? You said they all come from the same source. So if I were to ask where it comes from, would that be redundant? But isn't it also said that human weather and human emotions, that weather is also a manifestation of human consciousness that has something to do with all of this. 

**Higher Spirit:** The question you want to ask is where does the wind come from, right: 🗎 and how does it work 
**Higher Spirit:** And then your mind's favorite one is to say, let's say I got sick, where did this illness come from and then say how did this today... Where does this come from? So what your mind likes best is to use what you know... If you think about it for example you have a program in your head that has only a few programs in it, right? A few programs, like your words, you have a finite text that you want to understand, you have a finite program that you want to understand an infinite thing, you can't do that.

Understand my meaning? Because you can only understand what you already have in your mind. That is to say, I have these few tools in my mind. OK, the wind, it blows, and then some wind blows over, from the east, the west, etc.... Your mind only has this understanding ability. Then you want to understand something that is beyond the scope of understanding in your mind, but you can, for example, keep asking.
Why do you want to know where the wind comes from? Where does the wind come from? Why would it be that for you, you would want to figure it out? If I tell you that the wind comes from the sky, then you would be satisfied. You would be content. You would think that I have found the answer. The wind comes from the sky. Then in the future when you see your child, you tell him that the wind comes from the sky. Because this is what we obtained through psychic communication and then it's true. Do you understand what I mean? So no matter what answer you find from me, it's limiting you and it's like installing a program for you.

**Question:**I understand. Then can I ask, because this girl wants to raise this question today, then why does she want to raise this question today? Is there any special reason?
**Higher Spirit:** For her, she saw a gust of strong wind. A gust of strong wind brought her intense energy and this is related to her recent emotional experiences... Because she also felt a very strong inner energy emerging and she was a bit shocked by this energy, like is this me? Is this... She will have a little... Although she is allowing it and presenting it, she is still surprised by her energy. So when she saw a gust of wind, it was as if it awakened, as if she knew that I also had this energy within me and then she wanted to enter this is about a very powerful energy that manifested... A... That is to say, it's as if it entered your material mind and then is this energy terrifying? What will this energy do... Then all I need to say is that you don't need to have any worries. You can see from the wind that in your material world, that is, in the 'appearance', you can see that the wind has strong winds, gentle winds, right? Then sometimes it has very strong gusts or hurricanes, typhoons, strong energy but that energy will leave and then turn into gentle winds. So all of this is a process of all the changes in everything. Whether it's the energy of anger within you, or all the emotional energy, all the energy, the intense energy, it's all temporarily flowing through your body because it has touched a point within you. That point might be very important to you. It just happened to touch it, just as if you have many buttons on your body and when that button is pressed, you will have some intense reactions. Then precisely, some information it absorbs from the outside, what is seen from the outside, your five senses, your mind, your eyes, nose, ears, all of these are absorbing information in your material world, right?
Then in this absorption process, and then your five senses, your hearing, vision, everything you have is constantly absorbing information and absorbing information. For example, that information precisely touches your point. Then you will burst out with a lot of, for example, anger, and burst out with a lot of energy, understand? But you should know that all the appearances in your material world are an illusion, understand? Then think about it, for example, if there is someone who has fear in his heart, and then he spreads this fear out and then you hear the description of this fear, it may have changed in flavor, understand? It's like, and constantly, that is, I have fear in my mind and I project it out, I say it out, and then I pass it on to another person and another person touches his inner fear, understand? And then some of his illusions and some belief systems, that is, filter them again and then filter them to another person. Then on another person, it's like a receiver. Your physical body, and when you receive this information, you'll react immediately. This is your material world relationship, that is, a series of chain reactions between people and people, and between your body and your beliefs, that is, emotions. Understand? It's like if you don't react at all, that is, don't react to the information you absorb, you'll feel as if you've become powerless. Understand? Then the thing that you humans are most afraid of is that everything is not under your control. You want everything to be within your controllable range. When you have a feeling of losing control, you'll feel as if you're suffocating. So you will do... But if it is said that through this series of operating methods, you can see how an explosive point within you is... I mean, there is a flood within you, right?
Then there is a gate. What is it that opens this floodgate? Because once this gate is opened, its energy is super powerful. What opens that gate? It is the operating mode I just mentioned. Some people saw some events and generated some fears. Then he continues to pass it on. The second person who received it absorbs these fears and continues to pass it on. Next, next... It becomes all kinds of events manifested in your world, that is, the "appearance", everything you experience in the material world, all the struggles, disputes, all those topics, events, everything is generated like this. Then your internal conflicts and contradictions arise like this from yourselves first, and this is an operating mode. But you can still continue to ask, for example, how to deal with such a mechanism, how about this and that... It's like a series of reactions, right? A series of events, a series of reactions. Then how can we break away from these events? Because all the events that happen in the world, they are all a phase created by you, right? Then how can I jump out and no longer enter that energy vortex I just mentioned? Because you become passive, so you can continue to ask.

**Question:**Then how can we jump out of this and not enter such an energy vortex? Then it's fine to observe as well, or what should we do?
**Higher Spirit:**First of all, you have to know that even if you enter such an experience unconsciously and passively, you still have the power. It's you who are in control. You are in control within the vortex, right? OK. So today I entered this vortex, being brought in unconsciously by the energy. Now I know that I have the power to get out. I know how to get out. I know that I have entered another 'phase'. So how can I get out of this 'phase'? First of all, you have to know that you can get out. You are not powerless. Because often when you make some resistance, opposition, take some actions or behaviors, that is a reaction. You want to defend because you think you have to do so. You think you have no other choice. You are powerless. You have no choice. But this is an illusion. It's just a limitation in your minds. Because you think that some people say, "Why do I have to kill? Because I have no choice. I have to kill him." Such things are only within your perception range. You haven't found a way out yet. Today, we bring you into this vortex. We'll help you find a way out. Have you grown and benefited from this unconscious involvement in this event? So the first thing we need to do well is not to reject it. That is, not to reject this experience. Oh, you think that everything in the material world is false. I don't want to participate in it. I don't want to enter. Then what's your significance in the material world? Do you understand? You have missed a lot of growth. So first of all, you have to give meaning to all your experiences, that is to say, OK, this experience is meaningful. Then I'm going to transform it now. I want to benefit from this experience. I want to grow from this event. Because all events don't have a right or wrong. That is, we don't only let you choose the good ones. We don't allow you to choose the bad ones. We just tell you that there is no good or bad. It's just to see how this event can serve you and how you can benefit from it. In this way, you won't judge yourself, thinking why did I do such a bad thing again? Why did I unconsciously join such and such... So first of all, when you no longer have in your mind, you have a saying to avoid the bad and seek the good. This is just something that your minds have been doing all the time: avoiding all disasters, avoiding all the bad things, and then pursuing the good. Then when you let go of this concept, you can receive gifts from every moment of your present. So just now, it was said that although this event was formed like this, and then you found that you had fallen into it, now it is to accept it. This event is good and is here to serve me. That is your first step, right?
Then next is to say that the second step is that I have the power to transform it. What is the transformation? It is to make this seemingly negative event serve me. How does it serve me? No matter what, this event can bring me growth. For example, what makes me believe it so that it can cause such a big emotion in me?  and Because if you bury too many bombs within yourself, then not everything, with just a little disturbance, boom boom boom, keep exploding. That's how the temper flares up. But when you have dismantled all the bombs within yourself, will it still explode? It won't. You will only... It won't trigger any reaction in your body anymore. Because for external events, for instance, if there seems to be a terrifying event happening outside, right? Only when you have the corresponding frequency of fear within yourself will you be affected by it. For example, like a fly. For example, if there's a lot of fishy smell on your side, it will attract flies.
If all the fishy smell has been washed away, without any stinky or strange smell. Flies won't fly over. That is to say, you have similar frequencies, so you can apply... Because all your growth is not like being forty or fifty years old, year by year. You are growing at most by constantly accumulating memories and knowledge in your mind. It's confinement, something that limits you. At most, it's like this, making you more and more cannotmove. Do you understand what I mean? Because some beliefs in your mind tell you that no one can change this world. People are powerless, and you don't even want to move. So that is to say, true growth has nothing to do with this, nor with your age or the number of days passed. At most, it becomes experience. That is, you will accumulate a lot of experience, and you will accumulate many events. It's just like a camera. You keep recording, recording, recording. Then the real growth means that in every event you encounter, for example, the event you encountered today seems to be a picture, right? From this picture, you can have many learning points, comprehension points. Let's enlarge this picture and analyze here, here, here... You can rely on this picture because all the 'forms' in your physical world are like pictures, like mirrors. They are for your self-awareness, that is, self-cognition, self-growth, and self-breakthrough. They play this role for you. This 'form' is not static and won't just present like this. You might think it looks similar because you haven't learned from this 'form' and this image yet. So it will repeatedly present itself in your life, forcing you to discover and see. But your mind has a function of deceiving itself. The function of deceiving yourself is that you will rationalize some of your reactions. This is another trap. 'Ah, I do this because others do it like this and do it like that.' Do you understand what I mean? 'Ah, if they didn't do this or that.' This is your mind wanting you to continue to stay in your negative beliefs. Because think about it, if a belief is alive, remember this sentence. If it's alive, it can't survive without you and it disappears without you. Then all living things don't want to end, right?
